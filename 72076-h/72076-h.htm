<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>LADY KESTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a day of strenuous social activities, Lady Kesters
was enjoying a well-earned rest, reposing at full length
on a luxurious Chesterfield, with cushions of old brocade
piled at her back and a new French novel in her hand.
Nevertheless, her attention wandered from Anatole
France; every few minutes she raised her head to
listen intently, then, as a little silver clock chimed five
thin strokes, she rose, went over to a window, and, with
an impatient jerk, pulled aside the blind. She was
looking down into Mount Street, W., and endeavouring
to penetrate the gloom of a raw evening towards the
end of March.</p>

<p>It was evident that the lady was expecting some one,
for there were two cups and saucers on a well-equipped
tea-table, placed between the sofa and a cheerful log fire.</p>

<p>As the mistress of the house peers eagerly at passers-by,
we may avail ourselves of the opportunity to examine
her surroundings. There is an agreeable feeling of
ample space, softly shaded lights, and rich but subdued
colours. The polished floor is strewn with ancient
rugs; bookcases and rare cabinets exhibit costly contents;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
flowers are in profusion; the air is heavily scented
with white lilac; and a multitude of magazines and
papers lie scattered about in careless abundance.
<i>The Hibbert Journal</i>, the <i>Clarion</i>, <i>Le Revue des deux
mondes</i>, and the <i>Spectator</i> indicate a Catholic taste;
but we look in vain for a piano, a pet dog, or a workbasket.</p>

<p>As Lady Kesters turns from the window, it is seen
that she is tall and slim, with dark, expressive eyes, a
delicate, tip-tilted nose, and remarkably square chin;
her figure, which is faultless, shows to admirable advantage
in a simple gown of clinging black material.</p>

<p>And whilst she once more subsides into her sofa and
book, we may venture to introduce a little sketch of her
personal history.</p>

<p>Leila Wynyard and her brother Owen were the
orphan children of a dashing cavalry officer, who was
killed at polo, leaving family and creditors to the benevolence
of his relations. Sir Richard, his brother,
undertook charge of the boy, the girl—some years his
senior—fell to the lot of a maiden aunt who lived in
Eaton Terrace, and maintained considerable dignity
in a small house, on an income to correspond. Leila
had lessons and masters, her teeth, complexion, and
deportment were objects of anxious solicitude; at
eighteen she was brought out and presented, and hopes
were entertained that, in her first or second season, she
would make a suitable match, and secure a husband
and a home. The girl carried herself with grace, had
fine dark eyes, and fine fashionable connections; these
latter combined to take her into society, and exhibit
her at Ascot and Hurlingham, as well as balls and the
opera. She visited historical country seats and notable
Scottish moors, and was, so to speak, passed along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
from one house-party to another; and yet, despite her
friends’ exertions, Leila Wynyard failed to “go off.”
Perhaps the truth lay in the simple fact that the lady
herself was disinclined to move on; and often joked
over her social failure with her Aunt Eliza, who had a
keen sense of humour and no mind to lose the light of
her old age.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Leila Wynyard was known to
be penniless! (for what is a hundred a year?—it scarcely
keeps some women in hats) had no surpassing accomplishments
to lift her out of the ruck; it was also whispered
that she had an independent character, and a
sharp tongue!</p>

<p>No one could deny that Miss Wynyard’s air was
distinguished. Some men considered her a brilliant
conversationalist, and extraordinarily clever—but
these are rarely the attributes of the women they marry!</p>

<p>Time sped along, Miss Wynyard had been out
for nine seasons, was spoken of in the family as “poor
Leila,” and now relegated to the worst spare room,
expected to make herself useful, “do the flowers,” write
notes, and take over the bores. In short, she was about
to step into the position of permanent poor relation,
when, to the amazement of the whole connection, Leila
married herself off with triumphant success! Alone
she did it! Her uncle, Sir Richard Wynyard, owner
of the family title and estates, was an old bachelor, who
lived in a gloomy town house in Queen’s Gate, but
spent most of his time at his club. At uncertain intervals
he repaid hospitalities received, and entertained
his friends at dinner under his own roof—he scorned
the fashionable craze of assembling one’s guests at a
restaurant. These banquets were well done—wine,
ménu, and attendance being beyond criticism. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
would also have been insupportably dull, but for the
officiating hostess; and, thanks to Miss Wynyard’s
admirable supervision, they were usually an enviable
success.</p>

<p>The company were of a respectable age—the host’s
contemporaries—old club friends or City folk, with
their sedate and comfortable wives. Miss Wynyard
introduced an element of youth and vivacity into the
gathering, selected flowers for the table decoration,
had a word about the savouries and dessert, and, on the
evening itself, radiant and well dressed, enjoyed herself
prodigiously—for Leila had the flair of the born hostess—a
gift that had no opportunity for expanding in the
limited space at home.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, a certain Martin Kesters
sat on Miss Wynyard’s right hand—a plain, elderly man,
of few words and many thoughts, with rugged features,
grizzled whiskers, and a made tie!—a melancholy and
reluctant guest who rarely dined abroad, and had
martyrised himself to please and appease his old schoolfellow,
Dick Wynyard.</p>

<p>The brilliant Leila, who adored playing hostess and
giving her talents full scope, drew him out with surprising
subtlety, listened to his opinions with flattering deference,
put him at his ease and in good humour with himself, and
won, so to speak, his heart! She was not aware that
Mr. Kesters was a wealthy widower, and mainly responsible
for the enormous increase in her uncle’s fortunes;
but this would not have made an atom of difference.
Her attention would have been precisely the same had
he been a penniless curate; she could see that he was
overpowered by his partner—a magnificent matron who
talked exclusively of royalties—his answers were short
and gruff;—evidently he was bored to death and longing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
to be at home; and she instantly made up her mind to
capture his interest and rivet his attention.</p>

<p>Leila was on her mettle that night, and achieved a
notable success. How she shone! Even Sir Richard
was amazed—he was proud of, and not a little afraid of,
his clever niece; as for Mr. Kesters, he watched her
furtively, noted her upright grace, her animation, her
delightful smile, her art of saying the right thing—and
saying it well—her insidious dexterity in leading the
conversation into interesting channels, yet never obtruding
her own personality. It was <i>not</i> the excellence of
the champagne that made every one at the table feel
themselves unusually shining and brilliant. No, poor souls!
they were but the pale reflection of this luminous star.</p>

<p>Then the girl’s appearance—she was a girl to his
fifty-six years—of superb health and vitality. What
an inmate for a dull, drab home—what a stimulating
companion for a lonely man!</p>

<p>It was a cosy little party of eight, and at a sign from
the hostess, three matrons arose and preceded her up to
the ghostly drawing-room, there to feel depressingly flat
and to sip very superior coffee. After some devastating
comments on the British climate and the British
domestic, two of the quartette retired, whispering, to
a sofa, in order to discuss a cure—leaving Miss Wynyard
and Lady Billing <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>“This room is rather a dreadful specimen of Early
Victorian,” said Leila, waving an apologetic spoon. “I
fought so hard for these loose chintz covers and lamp-shades;
but everything else is as it was in grandmamma’s
time—there she is, between the windows, in yellow satin
and ringlets! The venerable servants who still survive
will not hear of a change. Do look at the carpet; it must
be fifty years of age. How old things <i>wear</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“I wonder Sir Richard does not live in a flat near his
club,” suggested her ladyship in diamonds and velvet;
“so much more comfortable and up-to-date.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but then this is the family town house, and
he is never quite sure that he won’t marry.”</p>

<p>“Marry!” repeated Lady Billing, “what an idea!”</p>

<p>“It is his favourite threat”—and Leila laughed—“if
the cooking is bad, the coal indifferent, or the
servants too autocratic.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t your brother his heir?” opening her eyes
to their widest extent. “How would he like that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I really don’t think Owen would care a straw;
he is rather happy-go-lucky, and never thinks of the
future. After all, Uncle Dick is not an old man, and I
don’t see why he should not please himself. I may dance
at his wedding yet!”</p>

<p>“I suppose there is no particular lady in the case?”
inquired the other judicially.</p>

<p>Miss Wynyard smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“Do you know, my dear, that you have made an
important conquest this evening?” Then, in answer
to Miss Wynyard’s gaze of amazement, “Mr. Kesters,”
she added, with impressive solemnity.</p>

<p>“Mr.—<i>Kesters</i>?” repeated Leila.</p>

<p>“Your neighbour at dinner, you know. He was
simply swept off his feet—any one could see that!” and
she flourished a puffy hand.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he has recovered his equilibrium by
now. Why, we never met till eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“He rarely goes anywhere. He is just a money-spinner—enormously
rich—he can make money, but he does not
know how to spend or enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“That’s easily learnt,” declared the young lady, with
a gay laugh; “I’d give him lessons with pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“Oh, my dear, it is not so easy to spend, when you
have the habit of years of economy. His wife was
terribly close; they say she counted the potatoes and
matches! She was his cousin, and had a nice fortune.”</p>

<p>“So, then, he is a widower?”</p>

<p>“Yes, this five years; he lives alone in Eaton Square—such
a frowzy house—it has never known a spring
cleaning! Mrs. Kesters and I exchanged calls. She
would not allow the windows to be opened; loved King
Charles dogs (horrid things) and parrots; dressed on
thirty pounds a year; and her only extravagance was
patent medicines. The premises simply reeked of them!
Latterly, she was a helpless invalid, and since her death
Mr. Kesters goes nowhere, just occupies a couple of
rooms, and devotes himself to business. Business is
his pleasure. He is a mighty man in the City—though
he is so shy and reserved in society. I declare you quite
woke him up to-night; I’ve known him for years, and I
never saw him so animated.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I hit on a lucky topic—he told me such
interesting things about mining and minerals.”</p>

<p>“<i>Gold</i> especially; they say everything he touches
turns to that! My husband and he are rather friendly,
and once or twice he has dined with us, scarcely uttered
a word, and looked as if he was going to sleep. Oh, here
they are!” as the door opened, and the two ladies on the
sofa suddenly concluded a mysterious and confidential
conversation, and sat expectant and erect. But the men
as one man made straight for Miss Wynyard.</p>

<p>Later, as the guests departed, Mr. Kesters lingered to
the last, and his host said fussily—</p>

<p>“I say, look here, Martin, I suppose you have your
carriage, and you may as well take my niece home;
you are going in her direction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“My dear uncle, why should you victimise Mr.
Kesters?” she protested; “I shall return as I came, in
a hansom.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Kesters intervened with unexpected gallantry,
and declared that to escort Miss Wynyard was an honour
that he could not forgo. Subsequently he conducted
her down to a shabby, “one-horse” brougham—the
coachman’s legs were wrapped in a specially odoriferous
stable rug—and conveyed her to Eaton Terrace. As
he took leave of her at the hall door, he ventured to put
a timid question.</p>

<p>He was such a near neighbour—might he come
and call?</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” assented the lady; “Aunt Eliza
will be delighted to see you—we are always at home on
Sundays, four to six.”</p>

<p>Subsequently Mr. Kesters became a regular visitor,
and met with Aunt Eliza’s approval; and, before many
Sundays had elapsed, a paragraph concerning the names
of Wynyard and Kesters appeared in the <i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p>And so poor Leila became rich Leila! and, from
being an insignificant relation, a person of considerable
social importance. Until her marriage few had discovered
Mrs. Kesters’ beauty—her cleverness had
never been disputed. Now, as the result of a visit to
Paris, armed with a cheque-book, she glorified her
appearance, wore charming frocks and exquisite jewels,
and, with her fine air and admirable figure, it was impossible
“to pass her unnoticed in a crowd.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kesters organised changes other than personal:
the gloomy abode in Eaton Square was sold, its contents
dispatched to an auction room—including two old
stuffed parrots, and the mangy remains of her predecessor’s
King Charles; another house was taken and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
furnished regardless of expense, a motor purchased,
and a staff of experienced servants engaged. In a surprisingly
short time Mrs. Martin Kesters of 202 Mount
Street, Grosvenor Square, had become a popular member
of society. Her little dinners and luncheons were
famous, not alone for the quality of the menu, but also
of the guests. Martin, too, had been transformed as by
a wand! His whiskers disappeared, he was persuaded
to change his tailor, and given a good conceit of himself.
He felt ten years younger, brisk, energetic, prepared
to enjoy his money and the Indian summer of his life.
Instead of being taciturn, he talked; instead of going
to sleep after dinner, he patronised the theatre; he
learnt to play bridge and golf. In the society of ladies
his manners had become assured, and he no longer
was at a helpless loss to know what to say, or stumbled
clumsily over their trains. For all these new accomplishments
he had to thank Leila; and he was devoted
to his brilliant and charming wife. She was more or
less in touch with political people, and clever men, and
women that mattered. The fascinating Mrs. Kesters
was successful in drawing-room diplomacy and the
delicate art of pulling strings; and, to her husband’s
astonishment, he had found himself a K.C.B., and elected
to an exclusive club—sitting on important committees,
dining in stately houses, and entertaining notable
guests.</p>

<p>Lady Kesters’ connections held up their hands,
cast up their eyes, and declared that “Leila was <i>too</i>
wonderful!” She had changed a dull, plodding, City
man into a well-turned-out, agreeable, bland individual—who
was her abject slave—and she had become a
leader in her own particular set. Her relatives repeated,
“Who would have thought Leila had it <i>in</i> her?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
But Leila had, so to speak, always “had it in her.”
“It” represented brains, tact, a passion for affairs and
managing, a hidden and ambitious spirit, and an active
and impatient longing to taste responsibility and power.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The clock pointed to a quarter past five. Lady
Kesters took up the silver caddy and was proceeding
to ladle out tea, when the door opened, a servant announced
“Mr. Wynyard,” and a remarkably good-looking
young man entered the room.</p>

<p>Before he could speak, Lady Kesters turned to the
butler, and said—</p>

<p>“Payne, if any one should call, I am not at home.”</p>

<p>“Very good, my lady,” he replied, and softly closed
the door.</p>

<p>A maid, who happened to be on the landing, witnessed
the recent arrival and overheard the order, now winked
at Payne with easy impudence, and gave a significant
sniff.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re sniffing about,” he said
peevishly. “I suppose you will allow her ladyship
to receive her own brother in peace and comfort, seeing
as he is just back from South America, and she hasn’t
laid eyes on him for near a year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s her brother, is it?” said the young
woman; “and an uncommonly fine young chap—better
looking than her ladyship by long chalks!”</p>

<p>“You go down to your tea and leave her ladyship’s
looks alone. I don’t know what you’re doing hanging
about this landing at such an hour of the day.”</p>

<p>Payne was an old servant in the Wynyard family,
and he was aware it had been generally said that “Master
Owen had the looks and Miss Leila the brains.” Master
Owen was always a wild, harum-scarum young fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
and it wasn’t at all unlikely that he had got into one of
his scrapes. With this conviction implanted in his
mind, Payne deliberately descended the stairs, issued
an edict to one of the footmen, and retired into his lair
and the evening paper.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>BROTHER AND SISTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>,” began Lady Kesters, as the door closed, “I
suppose you have seen him?”</p>

<p>“I have very much seen him,” replied her brother,
who had thrown himself into a chair; “I did a sprint
across the park, because I know your ladyship cannot
bear to be kept waiting. Everything must be done to
the minute in this establishment.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed; “and you come from a country
where time is no object—everything is for ‘To-morrow.’
Now, tell me about Uncle Richard. Was he furious?”</p>

<p>“No; I believe I would have got off better if he had
been in a rage. He received me in a ‘more in sorrow
than in anger’ frame of mind, spoke as deliberately as
if he had written his speech, and learnt it by heart; he
meant every word he said.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” said his sister, who had been filling the
teapot, and now closed the lid with a decisive snap. “Let
me hear all you can remember.”</p>

<p>“He said he had done his best for me since I was a
kid—his only brother’s son and his heir,—that he had
sent me to Eton——”</p>

<p>“As if you didn’t know that!” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“Engineered me into the Service——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes!” with a wave of her hand. “Tell
me something new.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“He says that he is sick of me and my failures—is
that new?”</p>

<p>“What does he propose?” asked Lady Kesters.</p>

<p>“He proposes that, for a change, I should try and
get along by myself, and no longer hang on to other
people.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is some sense in that.”</p>

<p>“He says that if I continue as I’ve begun, I’ll develop
into the awful loafer who haunts men’s clubs, trying to
borrow half a sov. from old pals, and worrying them
with begging letters.”</p>

<p>“A pretty future for <i>you</i>, Owen!”</p>

<p>“He swears I must work for my living and earn my
daily bread; and that, if, for two years from now, I can
maintain myself honourably in this country or the
Continent—Asia, Africa, and America are barred—and
neither get into debt, prison, or any matrimonial entanglement——”
he paused for a moment to laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said his sister impatiently; “and if you
comply with all these conditions?”</p>

<p>“He will reinstate me, put me into Wynyard to
take the place of his agent, and give me a handsome
screw. But if I play the fool, he takes his solemn oath
he will leave everything he possesses to a hospital,
and all I shall come in for will be the bare estate, an
empty house, and an empty title—and <i>that</i> he hopes
to keep me out of for the next thirty years!”</p>

<p>“No doubt he will,” agreed his sister; “we are—bar
accidents—a long-lived stock.”</p>

<p>“He also said that he was only fifty-six; he might
marry; a Lady Wynyard——”</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” she interposed; “the old servants
will never permit it, and never receive her. But how
are you to earn your living and your daily bread?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“That, he declares, is entirely <i>my</i> affair. Of course
he doesn’t expect much from a wooden-headed duffer
like me; he knows I’ve no brains, and no, what he
calls ‘initiative or push.’ He doesn’t care a rap if I
sweep a crossing or a chimney, as long as I am able to
maintain myself, become independent, and learn to
walk alone.”</p>

<p>“So that is Uncle Richard’s programme!” said
Lady Kesters reflectively. “Now, let’s have some tea,”
and she proceeded to pour it out. “The little cakes
are cold and stodgy, but try these sandwiches. Martin
is away to-night—he had to go to a big meeting in Leeds,
and won’t be home. I shall send for your things. I
suppose you are at your old quarters in Ryder Street?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they have been awfully decent to me, and
kept my belongings when I was away.”</p>

<p>“And you must come here for a week, and we will
think out some scheme. I wish you could stay on and
make your home here. But you know Martin has the
same sort of ideas as Uncle Richard; he began, when he
was eighteen, on a pound a week, and made his own
way, and thinks every young man should do the same.”</p>

<p>“I agree with him there—though it may sound
funny to hear me say so, Sis. I hope you don’t imagine
I’ve come back to loaf; I shall be only too glad to be
on my own.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have no money at all?” she inquired,
as she replenished his teacup.</p>

<p>“I have fifteen pounds, if you call that nothing, all
my London kit, a pair of guns, and a gold watch.”</p>

<p>“But what brought you back so suddenly? You
did not half explain to me this morning, when you
tumbled from the skies.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” he began, as he rose and put down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
his cup, “the Estancia I was on was of the wrong sort,
as it happened, and a rotten bad one. Uncle Richard
was tremendously keen to deport me, and he took
hold of the first thing he heard of, some crazy advice
from a blithering old club fogey who did not know
a blessed thing about the country. The Valencia
Estancia, a horse-breeding one, was far away inland—not
one of those nearer Buenos Ayres and civilisation,—it
belonged to a native. The proprietor, Vincino, was
paralysed from a bad fall, and the place was run by a
ruffian called Murcia. I did not mind roughing it;
it’s a splendid climate, and I liked the life itself well
enough. I got my fill of riding, and a little shooting—duck,
and a sort of partridge—and I appreciated the
freedom from the tall hat and visiting card.”</p>

<p>“You never used many of those!” she interposed.</p>

<p>“No. From the first I never could stand Murcia;
he was such an oily scoundrel, and an awful liar; so
mean and treacherous and cruel, both to men and
animals. He drank a lot of that frightfully strong spirit
that’s made out there—fermented cane—and sometimes
he was stark mad, knocking the servants and the
peons about; and as to the horses, he was a fiend to
them. He killed lots of the poor brutes by way of training;
lassoed them—and broke their hearts. It made
my blood boil, and, as much as I could, I took over the
breaking-in business. When I used to jaw him and
remonstrate, it made him wild, and he always had his
knife into me on the sly.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“The stiffest jobs, the longest days, the largest herds,
were naturally for the English ‘Gringo.’”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“A dog. He never called it to my face—he was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
much of the cur—but we had several shakes up, and the
last was <i>final</i>. One afternoon I caught him half-killing
a wretched woman that he said had been stealing
coffee. It was pay-day, all the employés, to a man and
child, were assembled in the patio—you know what that
is? An enclosed courtyard with the house round it.
This was a grand old dilapidated Spanish Estancia, with
a fine entrance of great iron gates. It was a warm, still
sort of afternoon. As I cantered across the campo I
heard harrowing shrieks, and, when I rode in, I soon saw
what was up! Murcia, crazy with drink, was holding
a wretched creature by her hair and belabouring her
with a cattle-whip, whilst the crowd looked on, and no
one stirred a finger.”</p>

<p>“You did?” leaning forward eagerly.</p>

<p>“Rather! I shouted to him to hold hard, and he
only cursed; so I jumped off the horse and went for him
straight. He dropped his victim and tried to lay on to
me with the whip; but the boot was on the other leg,
and I let him have it, I can tell you. It was not a matter
of fists, but flogging. My blood was up, and I scourged
that blackguard with all my soul and all my strength.
He ran round and round the patio yelling, whilst the
crowd grinned and approved. I settled some of Murcia’s
scores on the spot and paid for many blows and outrages!
In the end he collapsed in the dust, grovelling at my feet,
blubbering and groaning, ‘a worm and no man.’ I
think that’s in the Bible. Yes, I gave that hulking,
drunken brute a thrashing that he will never forget—and
those who saw it won’t forget it either. Naturally,
after such a performance I had to clear. You may do
a lot of things out there; you may even shoot a man, but
you must never lay hands on an overseer; so I made
tracks at once, without pay, bonus, character, or anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
except the adoration of the employés, my clothes,
and a few pounds. Murcia would have run me in, only
he would have shown up badly about the woman.
Well, I came down country in a cattle-train, and found
I was just short of coin to pay my way home.”</p>

<p>Leila stared into the fire in silence; her warm imagination
transported her to the scene her brother had described.
She, too, was on the campo, and heard the
cries of the woman; she saw the Englishman gallop
through the gates, saw the cowardly crowd, the maddened
ruffian, the victim, and the punishment!</p>

<p>“But what did you do with your salary?” she asked,
after an expressively long pause; “surely you had no way
of spending it?”</p>

<p>“That’s true. As I was to have a bonus, you know,
on the year, my salary was small, and I got rid of it easily
enough.”</p>

<p>“Cards!” she supplemented; “oh, of course. My
dear Owen, I’m afraid you are hopeless!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it’s hereditary! After the day’s
work there was nothing to do. All the other chaps
gambled, and I could not stand with my hands in my
pockets looking on; so I learnt the good old native
game of ‘Truco,’ but I had no luck—and lost my
dollars.”</p>

<p>“And after your arrival at Buenos Ayres in the cattle-train,
what happened?”</p>

<p>“Well, naturally, I had no spare cash to spend in that
little Paris: the Calle Florida, and the Café Florian, and
Palermo Park, saw nothing of <i>me</i>, much less the magnificent
Jockey Club. I searched about for a cast home!
I was determined to get back to the Old Country, for I
knew I’d do no good out there—I mean in Buenos Ayres;
so I went down to the Digue, where the big liners lie, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
cadged for a job. I believe they are pretty sick of chaps
asking for a lift home, and I had some difficulty in getting
a berth; but, after waiting several days, I got hold of a
captain to listen to me. I offered to stoke.”</p>

<p>“Owen!”</p>

<p>“Yes; but he said, ‘You look like a stoker, don’t
you? Why, you’re a gentleman! You couldn’t stand
the engine-room for an hour. However, as I see you are
not proud and they are short of hands in the stewards’
pantry, they might take you on to wash plates.’”</p>

<p>Lady Kesters made no remark; her expression was
sufficiently eloquent.</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ I agreed, ‘I’ll do my little best.’ So I
was made over to the head steward. We carried a full
number of passengers that trip, and, when one of the
saloon waiters fell sick, I was promoted into his place, as
I was clean and civil. Needless to say, I was thankful to
get away from the horrors of greasy plates and the fag
of cleaning knives. I can wait pretty well, the ladies
liked me—yes, and I liked them—and when we docked at
Southampton yesterday, Owen, as they called me, received
nearly six pounds in tips, not to speak of a steamer
chair and a white umbrella!”</p>

<p>As he concluded, he walked over to the fire and stood
with his back to it. His sister surveyed him reflectively;
she was thinking how impossible it was to realise that
her well-bred, smart-looking brother, in his admirably
cut clothes, and air of easy self-possession, had, within
twenty-four hours, been a steward at the beck and call
of the passengers on a liner. However, all she said
was—</p>

<p>“So at any rate you have made a start, and begun
to earn money already.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing new. I was never quite broke;”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and, diving into his pocket, he produced a little parcel,
which he tossed into her lap.</p>

<p>“For me?”</p>

<p>“For who else?”</p>

<p>He watched her attentively as she untied the narrow
bit of red and yellow ribbon, unfolded a flat box, and
discovered a beautiful plaque or clasp in old Spanish
paste. The design was exquisite, and the ornament
flashed like a coruscation of Brazilian diamonds.</p>

<p>“Oh, Owen, how perfect!” she gasped; “but how
dare you? It must have cost a fortune—as much as
your passage money,” and she looked up at him interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Never mind; it was a bargain. I picked it up in a
queer, poky little shop, and it’s real old, old Spanish—time
of Ferdinand and Isabella they said—and I felt I’d
like to take something home to you; it will look jolly
well on black, eh?”</p>

<p>“Do you know it’s just the sort of thing that I have
been aching to possess,” she said, now holding it against
her gown. “If you had searched for a year you couldn’t
have given me anything I liked so much—so beautiful
in itself, so rare and ancient, and so uncommon that
not one of my dear friends can copy it. Oh, it’s a
<i>treasure</i>”—standing up to look at her reflection as she
held the jewel against her bodice—“but all the same,
it was wicked of you to buy it!”</p>

<p>“There are only the two of us, Sis, and why shouldn’t
I give myself that pleasure?”</p>

<p>“What a pretty speech!” and she patted his arm
approvingly.</p>

<p>At this moment Payne entered, salver in hand.</p>

<p>“A telegram for you, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” picking it up, and tearing it open, “it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
from Martin. He is detained till Saturday—three
whole days;” then, turning to the butler, she said, “You
can take away the tea-table.”</p>

<p>As soon as the tea-things were removed, and Payne
and his satellite had departed, Lady Kesters produced
a gold case, selected a cigarette, settled herself comfortably
in a corner of the sofa, and said—</p>

<p>“Now, Owen, light up, and let us have a pow-wow!
Have you any plan in your head?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, “I’m afraid my head is, as
usual, pretty empty, and of course this ultimatum of
Uncle Richard’s has been a bit of a facer; I was in
hopes he’d give me another chance.”</p>

<p>“What sort of chance?”</p>

<p>“Something in South Africa.”</p>

<p>“Something in South Africa has been the will-o’-the-wisp
that has ruined lots of young men,” she said;
“you would do no good there, O. You haven’t enough
push, originality, or cheek; I believe you would find
yourself a tram conductor in Cape Town.”</p>

<p>“Then what about India? I might get a billet on
some tea estate—yes—and some shooting as well!”</p>

<p>“Tea-planters’ assistants, as far as I can gather, don’t
have much time for shooting. There is the tea-picking
to look after, and the coolies to overseer in all weathers.
I believe the work in the rains is awful and the pay is
poor—you’d be much more likely to get fever than
shooting. Have you any other scheme?”</p>

<p>She glanced at her brother, who was lying back in an
arm-chair, his hands clasped behind his head, his eyes
fixed on the fire. Yes, Owen was undeniably good to
look at, with his clean-shaven, clear-cut face, well-knit
figure, and length of limb. He shook his head, but after
a moment said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Now let us have your ideas, Sis. You are always
a sure draw!”</p>

<p>“What about matrimony?” she asked composedly,
and without raising her eyes.</p>

<p>He turned and surveyed her with a stare of ironical
amusement.</p>

<p>“On the principle that what is not enough for one
will support two—eh?”</p>

<p>“How can you be so silly! I don’t mean love in a
cottage; I’m thinking of an heiress. There are several,
so to speak, on the market, and I believe I could marry
you off remarkably well, if you were not too critical;
there is Miss Goldberger—a really good sort—enormously
rich, an orphan, and hideous to the verge of fascination.
She is in the racing set—and——”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Sis,” he broke in; “I’d rather
drive a ’bus or motor any day than live on my wife’s
fortune. If I married one of your rich friends I should
hate it, and I guarantee that she’d soon hate <i>me</i>; anyway,
I’m not keen on getting married. So, as the young
men in shops say, ‘and the next article, please?’”</p>

<p>“Of course I know I need not again waste my breath
talking to you of business. Martin got you a capital
opening in Mincing Lane, and you threw it up; he’d
taken a lot of trouble, and he is rather sore about it still.
He fancies you look down on the City.”</p>

<p>“I? He never made a greater mistake! The
City would soon look down on me. I’m no good at
figures; I’ve no business ability or smart alacrity. If
I had not taken myself off, I’d soon have been chucked
out; besides, I never could stick in an office all day
from ten to six. I’d much rather wash plates! I want
something that will keep me in the open air all the time,
rain or shine; and if I had to do with horses, so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the better. How about a place as groom—a breaker-in
of young hunters?”</p>

<p>“Not to be thought of!” she answered curtly.</p>

<p>“No?” then drawing out another cigarette, “do
you know, I’ve half a mind to enlist. You see, I know
something of soldiering—and I like it. I’d soon get my
stripes, and for choice I’d pick the ‘Death and Glory
Boys.’”</p>

<p>“Yes; you may like soldiering as an officer, with a
fair allowance, a couple of hunters, and polo ponies;
but I’m not sure that Trooper Wynyard would care
for stables, besides his drill and work, and I may be
wrong, but I think you have a couple of troop horses to
do up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I could manage all right! I’m rather handy
with horses, though I must confess the bronchos I’ve
been riding lately did not get much grooming.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Owen, I’m dead against enlisting, remember
that,” she said authoritatively. “I shall go and interview
Uncle Richard to-morrow morning, and have a
tooth-and-nail combat on your behalf, find out if he means
to stick to his intention, or if <i>I</i> can’t persuade him to
give you a job on the estate, say as assistant agent,
that would suit you?”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully clever, Sis,” said the young man,
now rising and leaning against the chimneypiece, “and
in every respect the head of the family. It’s downright
wonderful how successfully you manage other people’s
affairs, and give one a push here and a hand there. I
am aware that you have immense and far-reaching—er—influence.
You have been the making of Kesters.”</p>

<p>His sister dismissed the statement with an impatient
jerk of her cigarette.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you have,” he went on doggedly. “He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
formerly a common or garden wealthy man, whose daytime
was divided between meals and business; now
he’s a K.C.B., sits on all sorts of boards, has a fine place
in the country, shoots a bit, is a Deputy-Lieutenant,
and I don’t know what all—and <i>you’ve</i> done it! But
there is one person you cannot manage or move, and
that is Uncle Richard; he is like a stone figure that all
the wind and sun and rain may beat on, and he never
turns a hair.”</p>

<p>“How you do mix your metaphors!” she exclaimed;
“who ever saw a stone image with hair upon it! Well,”
rising to stand beside him, “I shall see what <i>I</i> can do in
the morning. Now, let us put the whole thing out of
our heads and have a jolly evening. Shall we go to a
theatre? I suppose you’ve not been inside one since
you were last in town?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I was at theatres in Buenos Ayres, the
Theatre Doria, a sort of music hall, where I saw some
ripping dancing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll telephone for stalls at something. You may
as well have all the fun you can before you start off to
plough your lonely furrow.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you, Sis. I’m a frightful
nuisance to the family—something between a bad
penny and a black sheep!”</p>

<p>“No, Owen, you know perfectly well you are neither,”
she protested, as she lit another cigarette. “You
mentioned just now there are only the two of us, and it
would be rather strange if we did not stick by one another.
And there is this to be said, that although you’ve been
wild and extravagant, and your gambling and practical
joking were shocking, all the time you remain a gentleman;
and there are two things in your favour—you
don’t drink——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“No, thank God!” he responded, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“As far as I know you have never been mixed
up with women—eh, Owen?” and she looked at him
steadily.</p>

<p>“No. To tell you the truth, I give them a wide
berth. I’ve seen some pretty awful affairs they had a
hand in. To be candid, I’m a little shy of your
sex.”</p>

<p>“That is funny, Owen,” she replied, “considering
it was on account of a woman you have just been thrown
out of a job.”</p>

<p>“You could hardly expect a man to stand by and
see a brute like Murcia knocking a poor creature about—half-killing
her—and never interfere!”</p>

<p>“No, of course; but you must not make the mistake
of being too chivalrous—chivalry is costly—and it is
my opinion that it has cost you a good deal already.
That detestable de Montfort was not the first who let
you in, or persuaded you to pull his chestnuts out of
the fire. Come now, own up—confess to the others.”</p>

<p>“No—no”—and he smiled—he had a charming
smile—“there is such a thing as honour among thieves.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very noble and generous, my dear
brother, but some of the thieves were <i>not</i> honourable.”</p>

<p>Her dear brother made no reply; he was staring fixedly
into the fire and thinking of Hugo de Montfort. How
little had he imagined, when he backed Hugo’s bill,
that the scribbling of his signature would make such
an awful change in his own life!</p>

<p>Hugo and he had been at Eton in the same house;
they had fagged together, sat side by side in chapel,
and frequently shared the same scrapes. Later they
had lost sight of one another, as Owen had struggled
into the Service and gone out to India. Some years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
later, when stationed at the depôt, he and de Montfort
had come across one another once more.</p>

<p>Hugo de Montfort was a self-possessed young man,
with sleek black hair and a pair of curiously unreadable
grey eyes: an idler about town—clever, crafty, unscrupulous,
and much given to cards and racing.</p>

<p>He welcomed his old pal Wynyard with enthusiasm—and
secretly marked him for his own. Wynyard—so
said report—was a nailing rider, a good sort, popular, and
known to be the nephew and heir of a rich, unmarried
uncle; so he played the rôle of old schoolfellow and best
pal for all it was worth.</p>

<p>The plausible, insidious scoundrel, who lived by his
wits, was on his last legs—though he kept the fact a
secret—was seen everywhere, carried a bold front, and
owned a magnificent 60 h.p. motor, which was useful
in more ways than one. He was staying at the Métropôle
at Folkestone, and, struck by a bright idea—so he
declared—motored over to Canterbury one fine Sunday
morning, and carried off his friend to lunch.</p>

<p>As they sat smoking and discussing recent race meetings,
weights, and jockeys, de Montfort suddenly put
down his cigar and said—</p>

<p>“I say, look here, Owen, old man. I’m in rather a
tight fix this week. I want two thousand to square a
bookie—and, like the real sporting chap you are—will
you back my name on a bill?”</p>

<p>Owen’s expression became unusually grave; backing
a bill was an iniquity hitherto unknown to him. Uncle
Dick had recently paid up handsomely, and he had given
certain promises; and, indeed, had curtailed his expenses,
sold two of his ponies, and had made up his mind to keep
strictly within his allowance.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s a mere form,” pursued de Montfort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
in his swaggering, off-hand way, “I swear to you. Do
you think I’d ask you, if it was not safe as a church! I’ll
have the coin in a fortnight; but just at the moment
I’m terribly short, and you know yourself what racing
debts mean. So I come to you, my old pal, before any
one; you are such a rare, good, generous, open-handed
sort! Don’t for a moment suppose that <i>you</i> will be
responsible,” declared this liar; “I’ll take up the bill
when it falls due; I’d as soon let in my own mother as
a pal like you.”</p>

<p>In short, Hugo was so urgent and so plausible,
that his victim was persuaded and carried away by
eloquence and old memories, accompanied de Montfort
to a writing-table, where he signed O. St. J. Wynyard—and
repented himself before his signature had been
blotted!</p>

<p>Two days later Owen received a beautiful silver
cigarette-case, inscribed, as a token of friendship from de
Montfort, and this was succeeded by an alarming silence.
When the time approached for the bill to fall due,
Wynyard wrote anxious epistles to his old schoolfellow—who
appeared to be one of the crowd who believe that
letters answer themselves! Then he went up to town
and sought him at his rooms and club; no one could give
him any tidings of Hugo beyond the fact that he was
abroad—a wide and unsatisfactory address. He sent
distracted telegrams to some of the runaway’s former
haunts; there was no reply. The fatal day arrived, and
Owen was compelled to interview his uncle and make
a clean breast of the whole business; and his uncle was
furious to the verge of apoplexy.</p>

<p>“They used to say,” he shouted, “put the fool of the
family into the army; but <i>my</i> fool shall not remain in the
Service! I’ll pay up the two thousand you’ve been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
robbed of for the sake of my name—and out you go!
Send in your papers to-day!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lady Kesters was contemplating her face in the overmantle,
which also reflected her brother’s unusually grave
visage.</p>

<p>“Owen,” she said, “what a pity it is that I hadn’t
your looks and you my brains.”</p>

<p>They presented a contrast, as they examined one
another in the glass. The woman’s dark, irregular face,
her keen, concentrated expression; the man with clear-cut
features, sleepy, deep-set grey eyes, and close-cropped
light brown hair.</p>

<p>“I think you are all right as you are, Sis,” he remarked,
after a reflective pause.</p>

<p>“But you are not,” she snapped. “Now, if you
had my head. Oh, how I long to be a man! I’d have
gone into Parliament. I’d have helped to manage the
affairs of a nation instead of the affairs of a family. I’d
have worked and slaved and made myself a name—yes,
and gone far!”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of going far?” he asked, in a lazy
voice.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she exclaimed, with a touch of passion, “you
have no ambition; you don’t even know what the word
means! Look at the men in the Commons, who have
worked themselves up from nothing to be powers in the
land, whose influence is far-reaching, whose voices are
heard at the ends of the earth. What would be your
ambition, come now?” and she surveyed him with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Certainly not to go into Parliament,” he answered,
“and sit in the worst atmosphere in London for eight
months of the year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“Well, at least it’s an electrical atmosphere, charged
with vitality! And your ambition?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“To win the Grand National, riding my own horse,
since you must know.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” she exclaimed, snapping her fingers with
a gesture of scorn, “and what a paltry aim!—the
yells of a raving mob, a ‘para’ in the papers, and the
chance of breaking your neck.”</p>

<p>“Better than breaking something else! I’m told
that a political career, with its incessant work, crushing
disappointments, worry, and fag, has broken many
a fellow’s heart.”</p>

<p>“Heart! Nonsense; I don’t believe you have one.
Well, now, as we are dining early, you had better see about
your things from Ryder Street, and I will go and ’phone
for stalls for <i>The Giddy Girl</i>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE LAST WORD GOES BEGGING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Richard Wynyard</span>, aged fifty-six, was a little,
grey, square-shouldered man, with a good heart and
bad temper. His father, the notorious Sir Fulke, had
put his two sons into the army, given them small and
irregularly paid allowances, and then abandoned them
to their own devices, whilst he squandered the family
patrimony on horses and cards. When Richard, his
heir, was quartered in Dublin, he fell desperately in
love with a beautiful Irish girl; but, painfully aware
of his own empty purse, he was too prudent to marry—unlike
his reckless younger brother, who adventured
a runaway match on a captain’s pay and debts. Major
Wynyard made no sign, much as this silence cost him,
and when, after his father’s death, he had at last a roof
to offer—Wynyard, a stately old place, although somewhat
dismantled—he sought his lady-love in haste, but,
alas! he was months too late; she had already been
summoned to another home,—the beautiful Rose O’Hara,
his heart’s desire, was dead.</p>

<p>This was said to have been Sir Richard’s sole love-affair,
and the one grief of his life. The late baronet’s
reckless extravagance had shattered the fortunes of his
descendants; his heir found himself compelled to let the
land, close the Hall, sell off the horses, and take up his
abode with his mother in the town house in Queen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Gate; where he lived and how, was indifferent to him,
he seemed to have no heart for anything. This was
attributed to his supreme disgust at inheriting such a
legacy of debt; but the real truth was that the loss
of the beautiful Rose had temporarily stunned her
lover.</p>

<p>Lady Wynyard, once a celebrated beauty, was now
a weak and withered old dowager, tyrannically ruled by
her servants. When she, too, was carried to the ancestral
vault, her son still remained in the gloomy family abode,
and, more from apathy than anything else, fell under the
thrall of her retainers.</p>

<p>Between his father’s and his mother’s debts, Sir
Richard found himself sorely pressed, and he took
Martin Kesters, his schoolfellow and friend, into his
confidence.</p>

<p>“I shall be a crippled man all my life,” he declared;
“it will take years to nurse the property into anything
like what it was in my grandfather’s day; and, by that
time, that young chap, Owen, will step into my shoes.”</p>

<p>“Well, Dick, if you don’t mind a bit of risk,” said
his companion, “I know a thing that will set you on
your legs and make your fortune; but it’s not absolutely
certain. Still, if it comes off, you get five hundred
per cent. for your money, and become a semi-millionaire.
It’s an Australian gold-mine, and I believe it’s
going to boom!”</p>

<p>“Anything is better than this half-and-half existence,”
said Sir Richard impatiently. “You have a
long head, Martin, and I’ll take your tip and put on all
I can scrape. I’ll mortgage some outlying land, sell
some of the good pictures and the library, and be either
a man or a mouse. For once in my life I’ll do a big
gamble. If I win, you say it’s a big thing; if I lose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
it means a few hundreds a year and a bedroom near my
club for the rest of my days. I take no middle course—I’ll
be a rich man or a pauper.”</p>

<p>And Sir Richard was as good as his word; he scraped
up fifteen thousand pounds, staked the whole sum on
his venture—and won.</p>

<p>Subsequently, he cleared the property, invested in
some securities, began to feel at ease in the world, and
travelled widely. Having known the pinch and humiliation
of genteel poverty and practised stern self-denial
in his youth, Sir Richard was naturally the last man
to have any sympathy with a nephew—a restless, reckless
scatter-brain—who was following in the footsteps
of his squandering forefathers. The good-looking
young scapegrace must have a sharp lesson, and learn
the value of money and independence.</p>

<p>Lady Kesters’ promised interview with her uncle
took place. He was fond of Leila in his own brusque
fashion, and secretly plumed himself on having
manœuvred her marriage.</p>

<p>“Well, Leila, I suppose you have come about this
precious brother of yours?” he began, as she was
ushered into the smoking-room.</p>

<p>“Of course I have, Uncle Dick,” she replied, as she
imprinted a kiss upon his cheek and swept into a chair.
“Something must be done!” and she looked at him
with speculative eagerness.</p>

<p>“There I agree with you,” he answered. “And
Owen is the man to do it. God helps those who help
themselves!”</p>

<p>“Owen is most anxious to make another start; but
it is not easy for a soldier man, brought up as he has
been.”</p>

<p>“Brought up as a rich man’s heir,” broke in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
uncle, with a quick, impatient movement; “more fool
the rich man! I gave the fellow a good education,
good allowance, good send-off. I got him into his father’s
old regiment, and made him a decent allowance; he did
fairly well in India, I admit; but as soon as he came
home to the depôt, he seemed to have lost his head.
Why, I believe the young scamp actually kept racers,
and as for his hunters, I never saw finer cattle in my
life! One day, when I happened to run down to Canterbury
to visit him, I noticed a servant exercising a couple
of horses—such a pair! I was bound to stop and admire
them, and the groom informed me that they belonged
to Lieutenant Wynyard of the Red Hussars; and Mr.
Wynyard’s uncle hadn’t as much as a donkey to his
name!”</p>

<p>“But could have thousands if he chose,” interposed
Leila. “As for racing, it was only his hunters Owen
put into regimental steeplechases and that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>“And that sort of thing came devilish expensive!”
snapped Sir Richard, who was now pacing the room.
“I had to pay his debts. I paid them <i>twice</i>, and he
promised on his word of honour to turn over a new leaf.
The next thing he did was to back a bill for an infernal
young swindler, and let me in for two thousand pounds—that
was the last straw!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it was,” assented his niece; “but
really, Uncle Dick, Owen was not so much to blame as
you believe. He was very steady out in India for four
years; coming home, as you say, went to his head; he
did not realise that money does not go nearly as far
here—especially in an expensive cavalry regiment. He
kept polo ponies and racing ponies in Lucknow, and
could not understand that he could not do the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
at home. As to the bill, he is not suspicious, or
sharp at reading character, and is staunch to old friends—or
those he mistakes for friends—as in the case of
young de Montfort. He had never heard what a ‘wrong
un’ he turned out; they were at Eton——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know—same house—same puppy-hole!”
growled her uncle.</p>

<p>“And when Mr. de Montfort looked up Owen and
told him a pathetic and plausible tale about his affairs,
and swore on his word of honour that his signature was
a mere formality—and——”</p>

<p>“Cleared off to Spain and left <i>me</i> to pay!” interposed
Sir Richard, coming to a halt.</p>

<p>“Owen had to pay too,” retorted his sister, with a
touch of bitterness.</p>

<p>“You mean that I made him leave the Service?
Yes, I could not afford to go on supporting an extravagant
young ass.”</p>

<p>“Owen is not brilliant, Uncle Dick, but he is no
fool.”</p>

<p>“A fool and another man’s money are soon parted.
Life was made too easy for the chap—very different to
what <i>I</i> found it at his age. I had no hunters, no dozens
of silk shirts, and rows of polo boots; <i>I</i> never was to
be met lounging down Piccadilly as if the whole earth
belonged to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, at least, Uncle Dick, you were never compelled
to give up a profession you adored, when you
were barely five-and-twenty.”</p>

<p>“I’ve given up a lot,” he answered forcibly, “and
when I was older than him; but never mind <i>me</i>; we
are talking of Owen. After leaving the Hussars, Kesters
took him on, and got him a capital billet in the City—a
nice soft berth, ten to four, but my gentleman could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
stand an office stool and tall hat, and in five months
he had chucked——”</p>

<p>Leila nodded. It was impossible to deny this
indictment.</p>

<p>“So then it was my turn again; and I thought a
little touch of real work would be good for the future
Sir Owen Wynyard, and, after some trouble, I heard of
a likely opening in the Argentine on the Valencia
Estancia, well out of the way of towns and temptation—a
horse-breeding ranch, too. You see I studied the
fellow’s tastes, eh?” And Sir Richard twirled his
eyeglasses by the string—a trick of his when he considered
that he had scored a point.</p>

<p>“I gave him his passage and outfit, and put a few
hundreds into the concern as a spec. and to insure him
an interest, and within twelve months here he is back
again on my hands—the proverbial rolling stone!” He
cleared his throat, and continued: “Now, Leila, my girl,
you have a head on your shoulders, and you know that
these rolling stones find their way to the bottom, and
I am going to block my specimen in good time. I
suppose he told you what I said to him yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he came straight to Mount Street from seeing
you.”</p>

<p>“He has got to shift for himself for two years, to
earn his bread, with or without butter, to guarantee
that he does not take a penny he has not worked for,
that he does not get into debt or any matrimonial
engagement; should he marry a chorus-girl, by Jove I’ll
burn down Wynyard! If, by the end of that time, he
turns up a steady, industrious, independent member of
society, I will make him my agent—he shall have an
adequate allowance, the house to live in, and most of
my money when I am dead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Lady Kesters was about to speak, but with a hasty
gesture her uncle interposed.</p>

<p>“I may as well add that I think myself safe in
offering this prize, for it’s my belief that Owen will never
win it. He has the family fever in his veins—the rage
for gambling—and he is like the patriarch Reuben,
‘unstable as water and cannot excel.’ At the end of six
months he will be penniless, and you and Kesters will
have to come to his rescue; for my part <i>I</i> wash my
hands of him.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Dick,” she said, rising, “I think you are too
hard on Owen; he would not have come back from
South America if he had not had a row with the manager
of the Estancia: surely you could not expect an English
gentleman—an Englishman—to stand by and see a poor
woman nearly beaten to death?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” with an impatient whirl of his glasses, “the
fellow has always as many excuses as an Irishman!”</p>

<p>“I think you are unjust,” she said, with a flash in
her dark eyes. “I admit that Owen has been extravagant
and foolish, but he was not worse, or half as bad, as
many young men in his position. Are you quite determined?
Won’t you give Owen another chance—or
even half a chance?”</p>

<p>“No; his future is now in his own hands, and I stick
to what I’ve said,” he declared, with irritable vehemence.
“You came here, my clever Leila, to talk me over.
Oh, you are good at that, but it’s no go this time!
I am honestly giving the boy his only remedy. Let me
see,” sitting down at his bureau, “what is the date?
Yes—look here—I make an entry. I give Owen two
years from to-day to work out his time—to-day is the
thirty-first of March.”</p>

<p>“But why not wait until to-morrow, and make it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the first of April?” suggested his niece, with a significant
and seductive smile.</p>

<p>“Leila,” he spluttered, “I’m astonished at you!
You jeer at me because I’m not disposed to keep your
beloved brother as an ‘<i>objêt de luxe</i>,’ eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t jeer, Uncle Dick, and I am sorry my tongue
was too many for me; but I can see both sides of the
question, and it <i>is</i> hard that, after indulging Owen as a
boy, sending him to Eton, putting him into the Hussars,
and letting him become accustomed to the Service, sport,
and society, you suddenly pull up and throw him out
in the world to sink or swim. What can he do?”</p>

<p>“That is for him to find out, and, since he wouldn’t
pull up, I must.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” she said, rising and coming closer
to him; “supposing Owen were to give you a promise
in writing that he would stick steadily to one situation
for two years, what would you say then?”</p>

<p>“I’d say that the promise would not be worth the
paper it was written on!” he answered, with gruff emphasis.
“Give <i>me</i> deeds, not documents.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that is your opinion and your last word?”</p>

<p>“It’s my opinion—yes—but as to the last word,
of course it’s <i>your</i> perquisite!” and he chuckled complacently.</p>

<p>Lady Kesters stood for a moment looking steadily
at her uncle, and he as steadily at her. Then she slowly
crossed the room and touched a bell to summon a
footman, who presently ushered her out of the house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>LEILA’S IDEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Lady Kesters motored home in her smart new Rolls-Royce,
her expression was unusually grave; for once
Uncle Dick had proved invulnerable, and she was overpowered
with surprise; for her ladyship was so accustomed
“to push the world before her,” to borrow an Irish
expression, that any little resistance affected her in the
nature of a shock.</p>

<p>Her brother was awaiting her in the smoking-room,
and as she entered and threw off her furs, he said—</p>

<p>“So it was no go, Leila! Your embassy was a
failure; defeat is written on your face—ahem—I told
you so!”</p>

<p>“Now, Owen, I call this base ingratitude. I’ve
wasted my whole morning fighting for you, I am worsted
in the battle, and you receive me with grins and gibes!”</p>

<p>“You see, I can understand Uncle Dick’s attitude;
he is pretty sick of me, and I don’t blame him; after all,
when you come to think of it, why should he support
a healthy, able-bodied duffer simply because he is his
nephew?”</p>

<p>“Worse than that,” amended his sister, “his heir!
<i>I</i> can understand his attitude even better than you, Owen.
As a young man he never had any real fling, and could
scarcely afford cabs and clothes or anything he wanted.
He was hampered by a hopelessly extravagant father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“And now in his old age he is tormented by a spendthrift
nephew.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I can’t exactly explain; but I grasp the
situation. You have had, what as a young man he never
enjoyed—that is to say, a splendid time—and chiefly at
his expense. He must feel just a little bit sore.”</p>

<p>“No; old Dick is a rattling good sort, and I don’t
agree with you, Leila. It’s not so much the money he
grudges, but that he thinks I’ll never do any good. I’ve
no ballast. I’ve got to sally out into the world, like the
hero in a fairy tale, and prove myself!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear brother; you practically start to-day,
March the 31st, and do you know that I’ve got an idea,—and
from Purdon, of all people. He is rather smart
looking, and might pass for a gentleman, till he opens his
mouth; besides, I happen to know that his mother lives
in Fulham, and keeps a small greengrocer’s shop.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but your idea? You don’t want me to start
in that line, do you?”</p>

<p>“No,” with an irrepressible smile; “I want you to
become a chauffeur!”</p>

<p>“A chauffeur!” he repeated, subsiding into an
adjacent arm-chair; “but why?”</p>

<p>“But why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, I used to drive a car—and yes—your
idea isn’t half bad; a chauffeur gets about the world
for nothing, has fair pay, and, by all accounts, bar
washing the car, a fairly good time.”</p>

<p>“You need not be thinking of a good time, Owen; but
put all idea of amusement out of your head, and make up
your mind that, during the next two years, you will be
<i>doing</i> time—as a punishment for your crimes! Now,
to be practical, you must have a certificate, and you
and I will run into the country for the next day or two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and you shall drive the car; of course you are out of
practice, and Purdon shall give you tips. I suppose you
know all about magnetos, carburetters, and speed? I
expect in a week you will qualify and pass, and there
you are!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady, in a new black leather suit. I’ll do
my best; I see you’ve fixed it up.”</p>

<p>She nodded assent. He was accustomed to Leila’s
fixing up of his affairs, and never disputed her authority.</p>

<p>“You can take the car out in the morning, and get
accustomed to the traffic. I think you will make an
excellent chauffeur, as you have a strong head and
no nerves.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may, and I’ve a sort of taste for mechanics.
As a kid, you remember, I was mad to be an engine-driver.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you were always blowing things up, or breaking
them down, or taking them to pieces.”</p>

<p>“I dare say I’ll have something of the breaking down
and taking to pieces in my new career.”</p>

<p>“Only it’s so frightfully risky; you might go in for
being an airman—<i>that’s</i> where you could make money!”</p>

<p>“Yes, with a two to one chance of breaking my
neck.”</p>

<p>“Think of ten thousand pounds earned in a few hours!
All the same it’s out of the question, I couldn’t bear the
anxiety, it’s too dangerous; though I see the day coming
when airships will displace motors, and I shall be flying
over to Paris to dine and do a theatre.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, give me mother earth and a 60 h.p. car!
Well, so it’s settled,” he said, jumping to his feet and
tossing the stump of his cigarette into the fire; “yes, I’ll
be a chauffeur all right—but what about the pay?”</p>

<p>“I expect you start at two guineas a week, with or
without clothes, and find yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“A hundred a year, and an open-air billet! I say, I
shall do splendidly. Leila, I feel that Uncle Dick’s prize
is already in my hand.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that! Bear in mind that
some situations may not suit you, that you may not suit
them, and be thrown out of employment.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; it has happened to me twice already—the
Army and the ranch—and I’ve no luck.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Owen?”</p>

<p>“I mean that nothing comes <i>my</i> way; other chaps
get all they want in big things, or little. Don’t you know
the sort that fall across people they wish to meet, that
get the best corners at a shoot, the best hands at cards,
that win big sweepstakes and lotteries, come in for fine
legacies, and, at a good old age, die very comfortably
in their beds?”</p>

<p>His sister nodded.</p>

<p>“I have one peculiarity. I can’t call it gift, and it’s
of no earthly value. I only wish it was marketable;
I’d pass it on like a shot.”</p>

<p>“What is it—second sight?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s all bosh! It’s—it’s—I don’t know how
to put it—the being on the spot when out-of-the-way
affairs come off,—sensational things, accidents, discoveries,
deaths. They seem to drop into my day’s
work in an extraordinary way; sometimes I begin to
think I’ve got the Evil Eye!”</p>

<p>“Now <i>that’s</i> nonsense if you like! You have knocked
about a good deal for the last seven years, and naturally
seen far more than people at home.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, I wish this queer sort of fate would
change, and shove me towards something different—a
good post.”</p>

<p>“And you believe you’d keep it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Anyway, I’d do my little best. My three weeks
as steward were a breaking-in.”</p>

<p>“But you were acting all the time, Owen—you
know you love it! and you realised that there was
a limit to the experience?”</p>

<p>“No, honour bright, I wasn’t playing the fool. I
am quick and ready, and not afraid of work. I say, look
here,” and he took his hands out of his pockets and
held them up, the palms towards her.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, my poor dear boy! they are like—like—leather!
Like a working man’s, only clean!”</p>

<p>“Well, I never was a kid-glove chap, and the reins
have hardly been out of them for twelve months. I’m
fairly good with my hands, although an awful duffer
with my head.”</p>

<p>“Just the opposite to me,” declared his sister; “I
can scarcely sew a button on, and I can’t do up a parcel
or tie a knot. But to return to our business. Once
you have a certificate, the next thing will be to find
you a situation. You had better begin in some very
quiet country place—a long way from Town and talk—and
I will recommend you.”</p>

<p>“<i>You!</i>” and he burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you may laugh; but who else is there?
We do not wish to invite the world into our family
laundry.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Leila.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly! I will give you an excellent
character,” she continued imperturbably, “as a sober,
respectable young man, most careful, obliging, and
anxious to please.”</p>

<p>“Well, that sounds all right.”</p>

<p>“And you must really be, as the French advertisements
say, ‘<i>un chauffeur sérieux</i>,’ and promise not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
play the fool, and I shall get you a nice situation that
I happen to know of, with two old ladies.”</p>

<p>“O Lord!” he expostulated; “can’t you make
it a couple of old gentlemen? I’d much rather go to
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, no doubt you would,” she answered; “but
you cannot pick and choose, and this place seems the
very one for a start. These are the two Miss Parretts.”</p>

<p>“I say, what a name! Any cats?”</p>

<p>“I believe they are an old French family—de
Palairet, and have the dark eyes and animation of the
race,—but they are so long in England, they have become
Parrett.”</p>

<p>“De Palairet <i>is</i> rather a mouthful. And whereabouts
do the old birds nest?”</p>

<p>“In a remote part of Midshire. I came across them
when I stayed with our cousins, the Davenants, down at
Westmere; when I was a girl I went there every summer,
but now the family place is sold.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Davenants are broke. Young Davenant
was in the Hussars with me, and was frightfully hard up.”</p>

<p>“The two Miss Parretts lived in the village of Ottinge—Ottinge-in-the-Marsh—in
a little old red cottage. They
had two maids, two cats, and a sweet garden. The
original property was in the neighbourhood, and the
family manor of the Parretts. The father of these old
ladies, Colonel Parrett, married in India, when he was a
sub., a planter’s daughter, simply because he, they say,
was <i>dared</i> to make her an offer—and whatever a Parrett
is dared to do—they do.”</p>

<p>“I say, I think I shall like them! I shall dare them
to double my salary.”</p>

<p>“The first Mrs. Parrett died and left a baby, your
future mistress. Her father sent her home, and married,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
years later, an Irish girl, and again his wife died and
left him with two more girls. One married the village
parson, the other lived with her father and sister in
the Manor. After the death of Colonel Parrett, it was
found that he had squandered all his money putting it
into follies: the Manor was mortgaged to the chimneys,
the daughters had to turn out, and for years lived in
genteel poverty. Now comes a turn of Fortune’s wheel!
Some distant Parrett relative bequeathed a heap of
money to Miss Parrett, and she and Miss Susan have
gone back to the Manor. Bella Parrett must be well
over seventy; Susan is about fifty, has the youngest
heart I ever knew in an elderly body, and is the most
unselfish creature in the world. Miss Parrett is an
egotistical old person, full of pedigree and importance,
but always delightfully sweet and affectionate to <i>me</i>. She
looks obstinate and self-willed, and I feel positive that
some one has dared her to buy a motor! I had a letter
from her the other day, asking me to take up the character
of a cook; she mentioned that she was about to purchase
a most beautiful automobile upholstered in green morocco
leather,—think of that! and would soon be looking
for a nice, steady, respectable young man as chauffeur,
and”—pointing at her brother with an ivory paper knife—“here
he is!”</p>

<p>“Is he?” he responded doubtfully, “I’m not so
sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I admit that it will be hideously dull, and I
can absolutely guarantee you against any sensational
experiences. It is just a sleepy little country place,
with few big people in the neighbourhood: no racing,
shockingly bad hunting—not that this will affect <i>you</i>—but
it will be an ideal spot for putting in the time. You
will never see a soul you know; I’ll keep you well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
supplied with books, papers, and news, and steal down
to see you now and then, ‘under the rose.’”</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t!” he protested, with a laugh, “think
of my spotless character.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I shall come all the same! The place is
notoriously healthy, I dare say you may get some good
fishing, you will hardly have anything to do—they
won’t go out much—of course you’ll pay a boy to clean
the car, and I’ve no doubt that the old ladies will take
an enormous fancy to you and leave you a fortune, and
you will be just as happy as the day is long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Then, in that case, my dear Sis, since
you say there is a chance of a great fortune and good
fishing, you may book me for the situation by the next
post.”</p>

<small>PLANS AND THREATS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the choice of Owen’s future employment was
duly imparted to his uncle and brother-in-law, the latter
received it with approval, the former with a series of
alarming explosions.</p>

<p>“His nephew—his heir—a common chauffeur! Outrageous!
Why not enlist, and be the King’s servant,
if livery he <i>must</i> wear?” Then, in a tone of angry sarcasm,
“I see—I see his reason. The fellow will be
gadding round, making believe to himself it’s his own
machine; to many young asses, driving a car is an
extraordinary pleasure. Yes, that’s why he hit on it!”
and he slapped his leg with a gesture of triumph.</p>

<p>“You are wrong, Uncle Richard, it was <i>I</i> who hit
on it,” protested the culprit. “Owen never had an
idea of being a chauffeur till I suggested it.”</p>

<p>“That’s likely enough; his ideas are few and far
between. Well, now look here, Leila, I forbid him to
adopt your plan.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear uncle, have you not washed your
hands of him for the next two years?” she demanded,
with raised brows. “Do you really think you are
consistent?”</p>

<p>“But a greasy chauffeur, got up in black leather, like
a boot——”</p>

<p>“The pay is not bad, it’s a job he can manage, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
after all, you will allow that Owen must live; or are
you going to say, ‘<i>Je n’en vois pas la necessité</i>’?”</p>

<p>“Umph! I wonder, Leila, where you got that
tongue of yours?”</p>

<p>“And,” dismissing the question with an airy gesture,
“I know of a nice quiet place in a country village, with
two darling old maiden ladies, where he will be, so to
speak, out at grass, with his shoes off!”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” he snarled, “<i>I</i> know your quiet, wicked
little country village, with the devil peeping behind
the hedges and finding plenty for an idle young man to do.
Villages are pestilential traps, swarming with pretty
girls. Just the place where Owen will fall into the
worst scrape of all—matrimony. He is a good-looking
chap; they’ll all be after him!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s a woman in Ottinge under
forty, and I never saw a more hard-featured lot—never.
You know I stayed in the neighbourhood with the
Davenants years ago.”</p>

<p>“Another thing—no one can take Owen for anything
but a gentleman!” and Sir Richard put up his
glasses and surveyed his niece, with an air as much as
to say, “There’s a poser!”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. He has only to show his hands, worn
with manual labour, and I’ll tell him to grow his hair
long, wear gaudy ties, and hold his tongue.”</p>

<p>“Well, have your own way! But, as sure as I’m
a living sinner, harm will come of this mad idea; it’s
nothing more or less than play-acting. He’d much
better have gone on the stage when he was about it.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, there’s one objection,—it is the
most precarious of all professions; for an amateur it
would be hard work and <i>no</i> pay. In five years Owen
might, with great luck, be earning thirty shillings a week.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Oh, I’ve thought over no end of plans, I can assure you,
Uncle Dick, and the chauffeur scheme is by far the
most promising.”</p>

<p>“Of course you always get the better of me in <i>talk</i>;
but I’ve my own opinion. You and Owen will make a
fine hash of his affairs between you. Bear in mind
that I won’t have the Wynyard name made little of in
a stinking garage. He is not to use it, or to let any one
know he is a Wynyard, and that’s flat; and you can
tell him that, as sure as he takes service as Owen Wynyard,
I’ll marry—and to that I stick!” and with this announcement,
and a very red face, he snatched up his
hat and departed.</p>

<p>Sir Martin Kesters, on the other hand, saw nothing
derogatory in his brother-in-law’s employment, and
warmly applauded the scheme. At twenty-six Owen
should be learning independence; moreover, it was his
wife’s plan, and, in his opinion, everything she said or
did was right. “I think it’s a sound scheme,” he said.
“If money is wanted, Leila, you know where to get it.”</p>

<p>“No, no; Owen has a little, and he must not touch
a halfpenny that he has not earned—it’s in the bond;
and he will have nothing to spend money on down there.
I don’t believe there’s a billiard-table or a pack of cards
in the place.”</p>

<p>“The typical hamlet, eh? Half a dozen cottages, a
pump, and an idiot—poor devil!”</p>

<p>“Owen or the idiot?”</p>

<p>“Both. All the same, Leila, I feel sure that, now
you’ve taken Owen in hand, he will come out on
top.”</p>

<p>Wynyard fell in with everything, without question
or argument, and cheerfully accepted his sister’s arrangements,
with the exception of the ties. He drew the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
line at an orange satin with green spots, or even a blue
with scarlet horse-shoes.</p>

<p>No, he declared, nothing would induce him to
be seen in them; he was always a quiet dresser. He
could wear a muffler, hold his tongue, or even drop his
h’s if necessary; but he barred making an object of
himself, and suggested that she should offer the discarded
ties as a birthday present to Payne.</p>

<p>“He’d give notice. Payne, in his unprofessional
kit, looks like a chief justice. Well, I won’t insist
on the ties, but you must promise to be <i>very</i> countrified
and dense. You know you can take off any one’s way
of talking in the most remarkable way, and do Uncle
Richard to the life!”</p>

<p>“One of my rare accomplishments; and as to being
dense, why, it’s my normal condition.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you may joke! But I do hope you won’t
let the cat out of the bag, Owen, or allow any one to
suspect that ‘things are not what they seem!’ I
wonder how you will manage in the kitchen and stables,
and if you will be unmasked?”</p>

<p>“Well, I promise to do my best to pick up the local
manners and patois, and, my dear Leila, you appear
to forget that for the last year I’ve lived among a very
mixed lot, and got on all right.”</p>

<p>“Got on all right!” she cried. “How <i>can</i> you
say so? when you told me yourself that you had half
killed a man! However, as you and I are confederates
in this most risky enterprise, I feel sure you will do
your utmost for my sake. Think of the uproar and
scandal if Miss Parrett were to discover that you were
<i>my</i> brother—late of Eton College and the Red Hussars.
Explanation would be impossible; I should be compelled
to flee the country!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> train which bore Wynyard to his situation was
slow, and lingered affectionately at every station; nevertheless
he enjoyed the leisurely journey. He was glad
to be in England once more! His eyes feasted greedily
on the long stretches of quiet, secluded country, nice
hunting fences, venerable villages crowding round a
church steeple, and stately old halls buried in hollows,
encompassed by their woods.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well advanced when he saw “Catsfield”
on a large board staring him in the face, and,
realising that he had reached his destination, seized his
bag, sprang out, and went in search of his luggage—a
corded tin box of a remarkably vivid yellow. His sister
had insisted upon this, instead of his old battered portmanteau,
as a part of his disguise. A portmanteau, she
declared, would give him away at once! For, no matter
how dilapidated and travel-stained, a portmanteau conferred
a certain position upon its owner!</p>

<p>There were but two people on the platform of the
forlorn little station, which seemed to have no business
and no belongings, but had, as it were, sat down
helplessly to rest in the middle of a sweeping plain of
pasture.</p>

<p>Outside the entrance no cabs or vehicles were to be
seen, merely an unpainted spring-cart drawn by a hairy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
bay mare. In reply to the traveller’s inquiries, the porter
said—</p>

<p>“Oh no, there’s no call for flies here, sir, no work for
’em; the cart was sent for a man-servant, and he ain’t
come. To Ottinge? Yes, sir, he’d take your luggage,
I dessay, and you, too, if you wouldn’t despise driving
with him.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t despise driving with any one; but, as I’m
rather stiff and dusty, I’ll walk. You say Ottinge is four
miles across the fields and seven by the road.” “Here,”
addressing the driver in the cart, “if you are going to
Ottinge, will you take my bag and box, and I’ll give you
a shilling?”</p>

<p>“All right, master; ’eave ’em in, Pete. Where to,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Miss Parrett’s, the Manor;” then, turning to the
porter, “can you point me out the short-cut?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, straight over the fields. First you go along
this ’ere road to the left, down a lane, then over the water-meadows
and a wooden bridge—ye can see the spire of
Ottinge Church, and if you steer to that, you can’t go far
out. Thank you,” touching his cap in acknowledgment
of sixpence.</p>

<p>As the stranger moved off with an even, swinging
stride, the two men stared after him with a gape of
astonishment.</p>

<p>“I’m jiggered if I don’t believe that’s the motor
chap after all!” said the driver; “why, he looks
like a regular toff, and talks high. I was bid to
fetch a young man, so I was, but there was no
word of a gentleman—and I know he’s boarding at
Sally Hogben’s.”</p>

<p>“It’s a queer start,” agreed the porter; “he’s a likely
looking fellow. I expect he’ll make rare work among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the maids!” as his eyes followed the active figure in
tweeds and leather gaiters, till it was lost to sight round
a bend in the road.</p>

<p>“That soort o’ chap won’t be long with them two old
women, you may take your oath. Lor’ bless ye, he’d
cut his throat! Why, you haven’t a good glass o’ beer
nor a pretty girl in the parish.”</p>

<p>“I’m none so sure o’ that!” retorted the driver, giving
the bay a smack with the reins, preparatory to starting;
“there’s a fair tap at the Drum, and a couple o’ rare
pretty faces in our church.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? I’m not to say busy on Sunday—one
down and one up—and maybe I’ll just step over and
have a look at ’em.”</p>

<p>“Eh, ye might go furder and fare worse! Well, I’m
off,” and he rattled away in his clumsy cart, with the
gay new box for its only load.</p>

<p>It was about four o’clock on a lovely afternoon in
April; the air was sweet and stimulating, and the newcomer
was conscious of a sense of exhilaration and satisfaction,
as he looked across the stretch of meadows lying
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Wynyard was country-bred, and the familiar sights
and sounds awakened pleasant memories. He noted
the bleating of lambs, the cries of plover, the hedges
powdered with thorn, and the patches of primroses.
Everything was so rural and so restful—such a contrast
to the roar of London, the skimming taxis, the hooting
and clanking of motors, and the reek of petrol; he had
stepped aside from the glare and noise into a byway.
As he strode along, steering steadily for the church spire,
his spirits rose with every step; he vaulted stiles, leapt
lazy little streams, and, coming to a river, which he crossed
by a rickety wooden bridge, found that he was within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
measurable distance of his destination, and paused for
a moment to survey it.</p>

<p>The village, which lay under the shelter of some low
hills, was long and straggling; red, hunched-up houses
and high-roofed, black barns had turned their backs on
the pasture, and a hoary church, with a high slated spire
and surrounded by a bodyguard of trees, stood sentry at
one end of Ottinge-in-the-Marsh. At the other, and
almost opposite to where he had halted, was an ancient
grey manor house of considerable pretensions, set in
creepers and encircled by yew hedges. A stone-faced,
sunk fence and a high wooden gate separated him from
this property, and, as far as he could judge, the only way
he could reach the village was by intruding into the
grounds. He looked up and down and could see nothing
but a fence abutting on the meadows, and, further on,
the backyards and gardens of the villagers. Like the
thundering ass he was, he had lost his way! He tried
the wooden gate, found it padlocked, and vaulted over—a
bold trespasser! As he alighted, a little figure,
which had been stooping over a flower-bed, raised itself
with a jerk, and he found himself face to face with a
bunchy old lady, trowel in hand. She wore a short
jacket made of Gordon tartan and a knitted hood with
shabby brown strings.</p>

<p>For a moment the two surveyed one another fixedly:
she, recognising that she was confronting a tall, handsome
young man of six or seven-and-twenty; he, that he
was gazing at a little woman, with grey hair worn in loops
at either side of a flattish face which was animated by a
pair of quick, suspicious eyes—round and black as those
of a bird.</p>

<p>“There is no right-of-way through these grounds!”
she announced, in a high reedy voice, something like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
child’s, but more authoritative; and as she opened her
mouth it was apparent that she was toothless as a newborn
babe.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” said the interloper, cap in hand,
“but I’m afraid I’ve missed the footpath and lost my
bearings. I want to get into the village.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re in the village here,” she answered tartly.
“You’ve only to go down that avenue,” pointing with
her trowel; “the Drum is on the left. I suppose you are
come about the fishing?”</p>

<p>“Thank you—no—I’ve nothing to do with fishing.”</p>

<p>Once more he took off his cap. She bowed from her
waist as if it was hinged, and again indicated his direction.</p>

<p>“The Manor?” echoed a yokel, in answer to Wynyard’s
question; “why,” with a grin, “yer just come out
o’ it, mister!”</p>

<p>He accordingly retraced his steps down the short
drive and rang at the hall door, which was at the side
of the dignified old house, and over the lintel of which
was the date, 1569, in deeply cut figures. A smart parlour-maid
answered the clanging bell, and stared in round-eyed
surprise.</p>

<p>“Can I see Miss Parrett?” he asked; “my name is
Owen. I’m the new chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“The chauffeur!” she repeated, with incredulous
emphasis. “Oh!—If you will just step inside, I’ll let her
know;” and, tripping before him down a long, resounding,
flagged passage—which seemingly ran the length of the
house—she ushered him into a low-pitched room, with
heavy oak beams, and mullioned windows facing south,
overlooking the meadows he had recently crossed—a vast,
spreading stretch of flat country outlined by a horizon of
woods—possibly those of some great demesne.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Miss Parrett,” said the maid, as, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
lingering look at the new arrival, she closed the
door.</p>

<p>The chauffeur awaited an interview for some time, as
it took Miss Parrett at least ten minutes to recover her
amazement, and invest herself with becoming dignity.
That man the chauffeur! Why, she had actually
mistaken him for a gentleman; but, of course, in these
socialistic days, the lower orders dressed and talked like
their betters; and she registered a mental vow to keep
the creature firmly in his place. The fact that she had
supposed her new chauffeur to be a visitor who rented the
fishing, was an error she never forgave herself—and the
origin of her secret animosity to Wynyard.</p>

<p>The room into which he had been ushered was heavily
wainscoted in oak; the chimneypiece, a most beautiful
specimen of carving—but some ignorant hand had painted
the whole with a sickly shade of pea-green! Various
tables and chairs, which had seen better days, were
scattered about; it was not a show apartment, but
evidently the retreat where people did all sorts of odd
jobs. A coil of picture wire, curtain rings, and a pile of
chintz patterns, were heaped on the round centre table,
and a stack of wall-papers littered the floor. A snug,
sunny, cheerful sort of den, which would make an A1
smoking-room. Precisely as the chauffeur arrived at this
opinion, the door was flung open, and Miss Parrett
ambled in.</p>

<p>“So <i>you</i> are my new chauffeur!” she began, in a shrill
voice, as she surveyed him with an air of acrid self-assertion.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” and Owen, as he looked at her, was
conscious of a nascent antagonism.</p>

<p>“Your name, I understand, is Owen. What’s your
christian name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>He coloured violently. What <i>was</i> his christian
name?</p>

<p>“St. John,” he answered, after a momentary hesitation.
(It was his second name.) “That is—I mean to
say—John.”</p>

<p>“St. John, what affectation! Of course it’s John—plain
John. I’ve engaged you on the recommendation
of my friend, Lady Kesters. She says you are steady,
efficient, and strictly <i>sober</i>,” looking him up and down;
“she mentioned you were smart—I suppose she meant
your clothes, eh?”</p>

<p>Wynyard made no reply, but kept his gaze fixed
steadily on a crack in the floor, and the old woman
continued—</p>

<p>“Of course Lady Kesters knows you personally?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I hope I shall find you satisfactory and experienced.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And not above your place—ahem!”—clearing her
throat—“I have recently purchased a most beautiful
motor, and I engaged you to drive it, and take great care
of it; it is lined with real morocco leather, and cost, second-hand,
five hundred pounds.” As she paused for a moment
to see if he was properly impressed, he repeated his
parrot’s cry of—</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“My sister and I propose to use it for paying calls at a
distance. You must drive <i>very</i> slowly and carefully,
and keep the car in perfect order, and spotlessly clean.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, ma’am,” he assented.</p>

<p>“Your wages will be, from to-day, two guineas a week.
You will live in the village. We have arranged for you
to board with a most respectable woman, and trust you
will give her as little trouble as possible, and we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
expect to see you in church at least once on Sunday.
You may join the Young Men’s Christian Association,
and the choir—and——”</p>

<p>But here he interrupted.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, ma’am, but I don’t think there’s anything
about church attendance and singing in our
agreement. Sunday, I presume, will be my day off, and I
shall be glad of some exercise.”</p>

<p>“You never mean to tell me you don’t go to
church?” she demanded, fixing him with her little
beady eyes; “as to exercise, you will get plenty of that
in the week—doing odd jobs and going messages. We are
only here about six months, and not nearly settled yet.”</p>

<p>“I,” he was about to add, “go to church when I
please;” but at this critical moment the door again
opened, and another lady, much younger than his
inquisitor, entered briskly. She had a long thin face, a
kindly expression, and a pair of bright blue eyes which
opened to their widest extent as she looked at Wynyard.</p>

<p>“I heard our new chauffeur had come,” she began,
rather breathlessly.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> chauffeur, Susan, if you please,” corrected Miss
Parrett, “seeing that I am paying his wages and he is to
drive <i>my</i> car.”</p>

<p>Miss Susan coloured faintly, and answered with a
nervous laugh—</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, dear, of course—of course.”</p>

<p>“His name is Owen—John Owen—and I have been
telling him of his duties, and how we only require to be
driven about the country <i>quietly</i>—no dashing, no
racing, no touring.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear sister, that is all very well for you who
are nervous; but I do love motoring, and I hope this young
man will take me for miles, and let me see something of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the country. I wish you would come with us, Bella,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t require you to invite me to use my <i>own</i> car,
Susan,” rejoined Bella, with crushing dignity. Wynyard
gathered that an increase of riches had not been to the
moral advantage of Miss Parrett, and felt sorry for her
snubbed relation; but Susan, a valiant soul, took what
the gods had given her or withheld, with extraordinary
philosophy, was never offended, envious, or out of
temper, and recovered from these humiliations with the
elasticity of an indiarubber ball.</p>

<p>“You left London early?” said Miss Parrett, turning
to him.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, at nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>Susan started at the sound of his voice; he spoke like
a gentleman!</p>

<p>“Then, no doubt you are ready for something to eat?
Susan, you may take the young man down the village
and introduce him to Mrs. Hogben, and, on the way, you
can show him the motor.” Then, to Wynyard, “And as
you find it, I shall expect you to <i>keep</i> it. I will give you
further orders in the morning.” Then, in the voice of a
person speaking to a child: “Now, go with Miss Susan.
You won’t be long?” she added, addressing her sister;
“there are those letters to be answered.”</p>

<p>“No; but anyway I must run up to the Rectory.
I’ve just had a note from Aurea; she came home last
night.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>MRS. HOGBEN AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Susan</span> preceded Owen, and as he stalked along the
great flagged passage, he noted her trim, light figure,
quantity of well-dressed, grizzled hair, and brisk, tripping
walk, and he made up his mind—although they had not as
yet exchanged a word—that he liked her immeasurably
the better of the sisters! How <i>could</i> Leila say they were
“dear old things!” Miss Parrett was neither more or
less than an ill-bred, purse-proud little bully. On their
way out he caught sight, through open doors, of other
rooms with mullioned windows, and more vague efforts
at refurnishing and embellishment.</p>

<p>“We are not long here,” explained Miss Susan, reaching
for her hat off a peg, and they crossed a vestibule
opening into a huge enclosed yard, “though we lived
here as children; it’s only lately we have come back to
our own—or rather my sister’s own,” she corrected,
with a little nervous laugh. “The Manor has been
occupied by a farmer for twenty-five years, and was
really in a dreadful state of neglect: the roof and upper
floors dropping to pieces, and everything that should
have been painted was neglected, and everything that
should not have been painted, <i>was</i> painted.”</p>

<p>In the yard a small black spaniel, who was chained
to his kennel, exhibited convulsions of joy on beholding
Miss Susan. As she stooped to unfasten the prisoner, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
instantly rushed at Wynyard, but after a critical
examination received him with civility.</p>

<p>“You are highly favoured,” remarked the lady;
“Joss, although a nobody himself, is most particular
as to who he knows. He means to know you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that—I like dogs. What breed is he?”</p>

<p>“That is a question we are so often asked. His
mother is a prize poodle, his father a small black
spaniel. We have never quite decided what we shall
bring him up as, sometimes we think we’ll clip him
and pass him off as a poodle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is much more of a spaniel—look at his
ears and tail,” objected the new chauffeur. “Of course
he <i>is</i> a bit too leggy.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m afraid poor Joss’s appearance is against
him, but his heart is in the right place.”</p>

<p>“Dogs’ hearts always are.”</p>

<p>“Joss is so sporting, if he only had a chance,” continued
Miss Susan. “He swims like a fish and is crazy
after water-fowl—that is the spaniel side. The poodle
blood makes him clever, sly, inquisitive, and as mischievous
as a monkey.”</p>

<p>“Is he your dog, miss?”</p>

<p>“No, he belongs to my sister, though she does not
care for animals; but she says a dog about the place
makes a topic of conversation for callers. We country
folk are often hard up; the weather and gardens are
our chief subjects. Joss is a capital watch—though I
hate to see him chained here day after day. I believe
a young dog requires liberty—yes, and amusement—as
much as a human being.” She glanced at Owen.
“You will think me silly!”</p>

<p>“No, miss, I’m entirely of your opinion.”</p>

<p>“And poor Joss leads such a dull life; there are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
young people to take him out, and no dogs of his own
class in the village, and now”—as she began to draw the
bolts of a coach-house door, but Owen came forward—“here
is the motor;” and, taking a long breath, she
ejaculated, “There!”</p>

<p>There indeed was the car, newly painted, and dark
green, as described. It was a closed motor brougham
to hold four. Owen examined it critically, and with
the eye of an expert. Within the last few days he had
become rather wise respecting cars. This was an old-fashioned
machine, which had seen a great deal of hard
wear, and would not stand much rough usage—no, nor
many long journeys.</p>

<p>“<i>Isn’t</i> it nice?” said Miss Susan, “and do look
at all the lovely pockets inside,” opening the door as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I don’t see any Stepney wheel,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, it has four—what more do you want?”</p>

<p>To which he replied by another question:</p>

<p>“Where did Miss Parrett get hold of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she bought it through an advertisement from
a gentleman who had ordered a larger car, and as he
didn’t want two—indeed, he made rather a favour of
selling it—he parted with this one, a bargain.”</p>

<p>“Oh—a bargain!” he repeated helplessly.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it <i>was</i> cheap for five hundred?”</p>

<p>Wynyard made no reply; in his opinion the machine
would have been dear at fifty. It was evident that
some unscrupulous rascal had foisted an old-fashioned
rattle-trap upon these ignorant and unsuspicious ladies.</p>

<p>“My sister is so nervous,” exclaimed Miss Susan,
“and I don’t think she will use the car as much as she
supposes. Even in a cab she sits all the time with her
eyes closed and her hands clenched. She would never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
have purchased the motor, only our brother-in-law, the
parson here—who is rather a wag in his way—chaffed
her, and, just to contradict him, she bought one within
a week!”</p>

<p>Miss Susan was evidently a talker, and Wynyard
listened in civil silence as, chattering incessantly, she
accompanied him down the drive and out into the
village street.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to take you to your lodgings, where
I hope you will be comfortable,” and she looked at him
with a kindly little smile. “There is where we lived
for thirty years,” pointing to a pretty old red cottage,
with a paved walk through a charming garden—at
present gay with daffodils and crocus.</p>

<p>“Do you know I planted every one of those bulbs
myself,” she said; “I’m a great gardener—my sister
only potters. The gardens at the Manor have run to
seed like the house, and it will take a long time to put
them straight. After we left it, on my father’s death,
the tenant was a farmer, and only lately my sister
has bought it back. A relative we never saw left
Bella all his fortune, and money comes just a <i>little</i>
strange to her at first. We have always been poor—and
so sometimes she—is——”</p>

<p>Miss Susan faltered, blushed, and came to a full
stop; she felt conscious that she was forgetting herself,
and talking to this stranger—a man-servant—as if he were
her equal! Her tongue always ran away with her;
unfortunately, she could not help it, and it was absolutely
true, as Bella repeatedly told her, “she was <i>much</i> too
familiar with the lower orders!”</p>

<p>“Ahem! I dare say you will find Ottinge dull after
London. Do you know London?” she inquired, after
a conscious silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Yes, miss, I know it well.”</p>

<p>“There’s no one much of your stamp in the village;
they are all Ottinge born and bred, and you seem to be
a superior sort of young man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m at all superior, miss; anyway,
I’ve got to earn my bread the same as other people.”</p>

<p>“Here we are at Mrs. Hogben’s,” she announced,
and, opening a gate, walked up the flagged path leading
to an old two-storeyed cottage, and a broadly built,
elderly woman, with a keen, eager face and a blue checked
apron, came to meet them, hastily wiping her wet hands.</p>

<p>“Here is your lodger, Mrs. Hogben; his name is
Owen,” explained Miss Susan; and Mrs. Hogben’s
astonishment was so complete that she so far forgot
herself as to drop him half a curtsey. “You have given
him the top back-room, I understand?” continued
Miss Susan, “and, <i>remember</i>, it’s not to be more than
half-a-crown a week; he will arrange about his board
himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Susan; to be sure, Miss Susan.”</p>

<p>“And you will do his washing moderately, and
cook, and make him comfortable, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Miss Susan.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you will eat meat more than once
a day,” turning to him, “eh?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, miss,” he answered, with a slow smile,
“a good deal would depend upon the meat.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you will find everything here all
right. Mrs. Hogben’s son, Tom, is one of our gardeners,
and you can come up in the morning with him. Good-evening
to you!” Wynyard touched his cap, and she
hurried off. He stood and watched her for a moment,
the slim, straight-backed figure tripping up the village
towards the tall grey church, which dominated the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Meanwhile, Mrs. Hogben had looked him over from
head to foot; her sharp, appraising eyes, rested with
satisfaction on her lodger; taken, womanlike, by a
handsome face, she said in a pleasant voice—</p>

<p>“So you’re the shover! My word, it do seem main
funny, them ladies a-settin’ up of a motor—and last year
they hadn’t as much as a wheelbarrow. Folks do say all
the money—and it’s a lot—has gotten to Miss Parrett’s
head, but she was always a terrible hard, headstrong
old woman. Now, Miss Susan there is a nice friendly
lady; all the place is main fond of Miss Susan.”</p>

<p>“She seems—a good sort.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and quite girlish still, and gay in herself, though
well over fifty, and thinks nothing a trouble. You’ll be
takin’ your meals here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with your permission, Mrs. Hogben.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have many high notions of food—just
plain and plenty, ye understand?”</p>

<p>“That will suit me all right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you your victuals in the little parlour,” and
she opened the door into a small gloomy room, with dead
geraniums in the window, a round table in the middle, a
horse-hair sofa against the wall, and shells upon the
mantelpiece. Evidently the apartment was rarely used;
it smelt intolerably of musty hay, and was cold as a vault.</p>

<p>“I think, if it’s all the same to you, I’ll take my meals
in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“All right,” she assented, “there’s only me and Tom.
Now come away up, and I’ll show you your room.”</p>

<p>The stairs, which climbed round a massive wooden
post, were so narrow, so low, and so steep, that getting up
was by no means an easy performance.</p>

<p>“Eh, but you’re a fine big man!” declared Mrs.
Hogben admiringly, “and somehow you don’t seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
fit in a place of this size; it’s main old too—some say as
old as the Manor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall fit all right,” he answered, looking about
his chamber.</p>

<p>It was very low and scrupulously clean: the window
was on a level with the bare boards, there was a wooden
bed, with a patchwork quilt, a chest of drawers, a
washstand, and a rush-bottomed chair.</p>

<p>“I shall want a bath,” he announced abruptly.</p>

<p>“A bath! Well, I never!”</p>

<p>“Yes; or, if the worst comes to the worst, an old wash-tub.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” reflecting, “I do believe Mrs. Frickett at the
Drum has a tin one she’d lend—no one there wants it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll carry up the water myself.”</p>

<p>“Will you so? I suppose your box is at the house,
and Tom will bring it down on the barrow. He will be in
to his tea directly. Here he is,” as the sound of clumping
boots ascended from below.</p>

<p>When confronted with Tom, Wynyard found him to
be a man of thirty, in rough working clothes, with one of
the finest faces he had ever seen, a square forehead,
clear-cut features, and a truly noble and benevolent
expression. The general effect was considerably marred
by the fact that Tom wore his thick brown hair several
inches too long, and a fringe of whiskers framed his face
and met under his chin, precisely as his father’s and
grandfather’s had done.</p>

<p>“Tom, here be Miss Parrett’s shover,” announced his
mother, “the man-servant, you know, as will bide with
us. You’ll take him in hand, and show him about, eh?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay,” agreed Tom, seating himself heavily at
table; then, addressing the guest—</p>

<p>“It’s very tricky weather?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Yes, it generally is in April.”</p>

<p>Tom stared hard at the newcomer. The young man
used grand words, had a strong look in his face, was well
set-up—and clean-shaved of a Wednesday!</p>

<p>“Yer from London, eh? One can see that. Ye
must be as hungry as a dog.” With an impulse of hospitality,
he pushed the loaf towards him, and subsequently
experienced a sense of relief and pleasure as he
noticed the new chap’s hands, the hands of a working
man!</p>

<p>The meal consisted of home-made bread, boiled eggs,
cold bacon, and tea. The two hungry men made considerable
ravages on bread and bacon, and no attempts
at conversation. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hogben’s sharp eyes
and wits were still engaged in taking stock of the newcomer.
He did not say much, but when he did speak,
it was the pure talk of gentry-folk; yet, he was not
uppish, his coat was well worn, and he spoke quite
humble-like to Miss Susan.</p>

<p>After a short silence, Mrs. Hogben—a notable gossip—undertook
the talking for all three.</p>

<p>“Of course it was Miss Parrett herself as come here
about a room for you, Mr. Owen, and says she to me, ‘I
want you to take a respectable young man on reasonable
terms; of course I can’t have him at the Manor, on
account of the maids.’”</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired her lodger, with his mouth
full.</p>

<p>“’Cause,” with a laugh, “she thought you might be
making love to them, I expect! And says she, ‘Mrs.
Hogben, you having no daughters, and no young woman
in the house, it will be quite safe.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” he assented, with an amused smile.</p>

<p>“Though for that matter,” and she nodded at Tom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
“I’m going to have a daughter-in-law one of these
days.”</p>

<p>Tom buried his face in a mug and spluttered.</p>

<p>“Ay, it’s Dilly Topham, and a main pretty girl too;
but Tom will mind <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“Miss Parrett is terrible strict,” said Tom, recovering
his self-possession, “and this do be a model village”; and
he winked at Wynyard.</p>

<p>“I’m none so sure!” objected his mother; “there’s
a good lot of beer and quarrelling at the Drum, especially
of a Saturday night; and there was Katie Punnett—well—well—I
say no more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the girls are all right, mother.”</p>

<p>“Some on ’em; of course that’s Missie’s doing—she’s
so friendly with ’em, so nice and so gay; but a good
few of the Ottinge girls is of no account. There’s Mrs.
Watkins with three big young women on her hands; they
won’t stay in service at no price, and they won’t do a turn
at home. Their mother holds the house together, and
has them, as well as her man, to work for, poor soul!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Watkins, he does ’is share as carrier,” protested
Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what <i>you</i> call a share, Tom,” said his
mother sharply. “I know of a cold winter’s morning
she gets up and milks the cows, and takes the milk round
herself, and comes back, and there’s not a fire lit, and
them four lazy sacks are all still abed—ay, and asleep.
I’ve gone in of an afternoon, too, and seen Maudie and
Brenda stretched on their backs a-reading penny novels—it’s
all they care for, that and dress, and young men;
if I was their mother I’d let out at them!” and she paused
for breath. “<i>I</i> never had no schoolin’, and I’m not sorry;
laziness and light readin’ is the plague.”</p>

<p>“Well, Watkins—he don’t read overmuch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“No, but he smokes and drinks, and is main idle.
You know yourself I offered him the good grass off the
orchard for the cutting, for his horse—lovely grass it were,
too—but it were too much trouble, and he grazes the poor
beast along the road in every one’s way instead. And
there’s Jake Roberts—his father left him a fine business
as wheelwright and carpenter, and he has let it all go over
to Shrapton-le-Steeple ’cause it was too much fag, and he
lives on his wife’s washing.”</p>

<p>“Ye see how my mother is down on Ottinge,” said
Tom, with another wink, “not being an Ottinge woman
herself.”</p>

<p>“No, thank the Lord! I’m from another part, and
all for work. But I’ll say this—that Ottinge is the
healthiest spot ye ever put yer foot in. We gets the
free air for miles over the pastures, and at the back we’re
in shelter from the hills between us and Brodfield—that’s
the big town ten miles off.”</p>

<p>“So you have no doctor?” said Wynyard.</p>

<p>“Indeed we have, and a good doctor too; there is
not much call for him or for medicines. Ottinge isn’t as
big as it looks; though so rambling and showy, it’s real
small.”</p>

<p>“Are there many gentry around?” inquired the
stranger.</p>

<p>“There’s the parson, Mr. Morven—his lady is dead.
She wur a Parrett, and handsome. He’s a good man, but
terrible bookish, and just awful for readin’ and writin’.
There’s Captain and the Honourable Mrs. Ramsay, as
live nearly opposite in the house covered with ivy, and
three rows of long windows, inside the little brick wall.
<i>They</i> are not much use; she sells plants and cuttings,
and little Pom puppies now and then, and keeps what
she calls a ‘Dogs’ Hotel or Boarding-House’; did ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
ever!” and Mrs. Hogben laughed. “Ay, and she advertises
it too! She’s so terrible busy with dogs, and takes
them walking out, and has all sorts o’ food for them, and
young Bob Watkins as their servant. Her father was
a lord they make out, and her husband, the Captain, he
got some sort of stroke in the Indies and is queer—some
say from drink, some say from a stroke, some say from
both. He never goes into no company, but walks the
roads and lanes of an evening a-talkin’ to himself right
out loud. Then he slopes up to the Drum, and though
he was an army officer, he sits cheek by jowl with common
men, drinkin’ his glass, and smokin’ his pipe. However,
he is quiet enough—quiet as the dead—and Mrs. Ramsay
is good pay.”</p>

<p>“That’s something,” remarked her listener, and his
tone was dry.</p>

<p>“There’s a rare bit o’ money in Ottinge, though ye
mightn’t think it,” continued Mrs. Hogben, delighted to
have a listener after her own heart; “folks being well left,
and mostly having a snug house, and nothing going out
but quit rent.”</p>

<p>“But who lives round the village? Are there any
big places?”</p>

<p>“There’s a good few within ten miles. The Wardes
of Braske, the Cranmers of Wells Castle, the Woolcocks
of Westmere Park—it was the Davenants’ for hundreds
of years, and Woolcocks’ father he was an iron-monger!”</p>

<p>“An ironmaster,” corrected her son, with a touch of
impatience.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis all the same. The Davenants were real
great folk, and the Hogbens served them for many a day;
indeed, the late Sir Henry Davenant shot Hogben’s
father himself.” She folded her arms as she made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
announcement, and looked at her lodger as much as to
say, “What do you think of <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Shot! What do you mean—on purpose?”</p>

<p>“No, ’twas a pheasant he was mistook for—but he
killed Tom Hogben stone dead in the top cover, and
then sent a carriage to fetch him home. Of course the
shooting was given accidental, and the family had a
pension; and I will say this, the Davenants were always
free and never a mite afraid of spending money, till
every stiver was gone.”</p>

<p>“What you call open-handed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the last of the gentlemen, when the place
was ate up of a mortgage, lived in a bit of a cottage
by the roadside, and was just as proud and grand as if
he had forty servants. This Ottinge is a mighty queer
quarrelling sort o’ place, as you will soon see for yourself.
Last year a parson come, when Mr. Morven was
in Switzerland with the General—a very gay, pleasant
young man, a-visitin’ everywhere, and talkin’ to every
one, and amusin’ the parish, and gettin’ up cricket,
and concerts, so when he left they gathered up to make
him a present, and bought him a lovely clock (as he
preferred to a bit of a ink-bottle); but it just shows up
Ottinge! there was so much wicked jealousy and ill-feelin’
that there was no one to <i>give</i> it to him—you
see, one wouldn’t let the other!—and he’d never have
got it at all, only, at the last, they stuck in a child—a
little girl, as no one wanted to get the better of—and
so that settled it, but it may give ye <i>some</i> idea of the
place.”</p>

<p>“Ye see my mother hasn’t a good word for it,” put
in Tom; “but I’m Ottinge, and was born here.”</p>

<p>“As to the gentlefolk,” continued Mrs. Hogben
almost as glibly as if she were reading aloud, “there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the doctor and his wife. She is gayish, and great at
theatricals and games—no harm, though. Ay, ’tis a
dull place for young folk, and only fit for some to come
and end their days. There’s the Woolcocks of Westmere
Park—terrible rich—they bought the Park when the
Davenants were broke, as I tell’d ye. They keep a crowd
of servants, and three motors. There’s mister and
missus, and a son and two daughters—one of them’s
married. They give a fair lot of employment too—but
still, folks ’ud rayther have the old fam’ly.”</p>

<p>“My mother goes round telling of folk here and
there, and she’s left out the one that matters <i>most</i>, that
starts everything in the village, and is the prettiest girl—bar
one—in ten parishes—and that’s Miss Aurea!”</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Aurea, of course, she’s not to be overlooked,”
said Mrs. Hogben, “not nowhere—Miss
Parrett’s niece, and the parson’s daughter; but she’s not
here now, she’s a-stoppin’ up in London with her father’s
brother the General—often she does be there—the only
child to go round in three families.”</p>

<p>Wynyard said to himself that he was actually better
posted up in village gossip than Mrs. Hogben; she did
not know, as <i>he</i> did, that Miss Aurea had returned home!</p>

<p>“She manages her aunt wonderful, that she do;
indeed, she manages most things.”</p>

<p>“She’s awful taken up with settling the Manor House
and the garden,” added Tom; “she has a lucky hand,
and a real love for flowers.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and folk do say that Woolcock of Westmere,
the only son, has a real love for <i>her</i>,” supplemented Mrs.
Hogben, as she rose and pushed back her chair; “it
would be a sensible thing to wed old family to good
money.”</p>

<p>The newcomer rose also, picked up his cap, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
walked to the open door. He had heard the latest news
of Ottinge-in-the-Marsh, and now he intended to have a
look round the village itself.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll take a bit of a stroll and smoke a
pipe,” he said, as he put on his cap and went out.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the new lodger, Tom?” asked
his mother, as she noisily collected plates and cups.</p>

<p>“I think—it’s hard to say yet; but I likes him. He’s
not our sort, though.”</p>

<p>“Why not? He’s had a good eddication, that’s
sure, and talks up in his head like gentry, but his
hands is just the hands of a working man; and look at
his box—that’s no class!”</p>

<p>In the opinion of Mrs. Hogben the box settled the
question, and she went off into the scullery and closed
the door with a slam of finality.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>OTTINGE-IN-THE-MARSH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wynyard</span> strolled out into the little front garden along
the red brick path to the wooden gate; as he closed
this, he observed that it bore in large characters the
enticing name of “Holiday Cottage.” He smiled rather
grimly as he looked back at his new residence, a wood
and plaster construction, bowed in the upper storey,
with small, insignificant windows. Then he glanced
up and down the empty thoroughfare, and was struck
by the deathlike silence of the place. What had become
of the residents of Ottinge? A flock of soiled, white
ducks waddling home in single file from the marshes,
and a wall-eyed sheep-dog, were the only live objects
in sight.</p>

<p>Ottinge was undeniably ancient and picturesque,
a rare field for an artist; the houses were detached—no
two alike—and appeared to have been built without
the smallest attempt at regularity. Some stood sideways
at right angles; others had turned their backs upon the
street, and overlooked the fields; many were timbered;
several were entirely composed of black boarding; one
or two were yellow; but the majority were of rusty brick,
with tiled and moss-grown roofs. Wynyard noticed
the ivy-clad house or “dogs’” hotel, with its three
rows of long, prim windows, and close by another of the
same class, with a heavy yew porch that recalled a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
great moustache. On its neat green gate was affixed a
brass plate and the inscription—<span class="smcap">D. Boas</span>, M.D. Farther
on at intervals were more houses and a few scattered
shops; these looked as if they were anxious to conceal
their identity, and only suffered a limited display of
their wares. Chief among them was one double-fronted,
with tins of pressed beef and oatmeal on view, and above
the door the worthy signboard—<span class="smcap">T. Hoad</span>, Grocer.
“Quality is my Watchword.” Next came John Death,
Butcher, with a wide window, over which an awning
had been discreetly lowered.</p>

<p>Almost every house had its front garden, with a brick
wall or palings between it and the road. One, with a
flagged path, an arbour, and a bald, white face, exhibited
a square board close under the eaves, on which was
briefly inscribed the seductive invitation, “<span class="smcap">Tea</span>.” An
adjoining neighbour, with absolutely bare surroundings,
had affixed to his porch the notice, “<span class="smcap">Cut Flowers</span>”;
and, from the two advertisements, it was evident that
the all-penetrating motor had discovered the existence
of Ottinge-in-the-Marsh!</p>

<p>The next object of note—and in daring proximity
to the church—was the Drum Inn; an undoubtedly
ancient black-and-white building, with dormer windows,
an overhanging top storey, and stack of imposing
chimneys. It was strikingly picturesque without (if
cramped and uncomfortable within), and stood forth
prominently into the street considerably in advance
of its neighbours, as if to claim most particular attention;
it was a fact that the Drum had been frequently
sketched, and was also the subject of a (locally)
popular postcard.</p>

<p>The tall church, grey and dignified, was a fitting
conclusion to this old-world hamlet; parts of it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
said to date from the seventh century. Splendid elms
and oaks of unknown age sheltered the stately edifice,
and close by, the last house in Ottinge, was the dignified
Queen Anne rectory. Surrounded by shaven lawns
and an imposing extent of garden walls, it had an appearance
of mellow age, high breeding, and prosperity. The
sitting-room windows stood open, the curtains were not
yet drawn, and Wynyard, noticing one or two flitting
figures, permitted his mind to wonder if one of these
was Miss Aurea, who, so to speak, ran the village,
ruled the Manor, and was, according to Thomas Hogben,
the prettiest girl—bar one—in ten parishes?</p>

<p>Pipe in mouth, the explorer wandered along for
some distance, and presently came to a farmhouse,
encircled by enormous black barns and timbered outhouses,
with thatched, sloping roofs; but there was no
smoke from the farm chimney, no sound from stables
or byre; the yard was covered with grass, the very
duck-pond was dry. A former tenant and his family,
finding the old world too strong for them, had fled
to Canada many years previously, and ever since Claringbold’s
farm had remained empty and desolate. In
autumn, the village urchins pillaged the orchard; in
winter, wandering tramps encamped in the outhouses.
Never again would there be a sound of lowing cows,
the humming of threshing gear, the shouts of carters
encouraging their horses, or children’s voices calling to
their dogs.</p>

<p>The newcomer leant his arms upon the gate and
surveyed the low, flat country with its distant, dark
horizon. Then he turned to contemplate the hills
behind the church, dotted with sheep and lambs and
scored with lanes; he must learn his bearings in this
new locality, as behoved his duty as chauffeur. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
had now inspected Ottinge from end to end, from the
low-lying grey Manor, projecting into its fields, to the
Queen Anne rectory, a picture of mellowed peace.</p>

<p>So here he was to live, no matter what befell. He
wondered what would befall, and what the next year
held in store for him? For nearly an hour he remained
leaning on the stout old gate, giving his thoughts a
free rein, and making stern resolutions. Somehow he
did not feel drawn to his billet, nor yet to Miss Parrett,
but he resolved that he would play the game, and
not disappoint Leila. She had, as usual, taken her own
line; but had he chosen his fate he would have preferred
a rough-and-tumble town life, active employment in
some big garage, and to be thrown among men, and not
a pack of old women! However, in a town he might
be spotted by his friends; here, in this dead-and-alive
village, his position was unassailable, and possibly
Leila was right—it was her normal attitude.</p>

<p>At last he recognised that the soft April night had
fallen, bats were flitting by, the marsh frogs’ concert
had commenced—it was time to go back to Holiday
Cottage, and turn in, for no doubt the Hogbens were
early birds.</p>

<p>The ceiling of his room was so low that he hit his
head violently against a beam, and uttered an angry
swear word.</p>

<p>The place, which held an atmosphere of yellow soap
and dry rot, was palsied with age; a sloping, creaking
floor shook ominously under his tread; if it collapsed,
and he were precipitated into the kitchen, what an
ignominious ending!</p>

<p>In a short time Mrs. Hogben’s new lodger had
stretched himself upon his narrow, lumpy bed, and,
being tired, soon fell asleep, and slept like the proverbial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
log, until he was awoke by daylight streaming in at the
window, and the sound of some one labouring vigorously
at the pump. He looked at his watch—seven o’clock—he
must rise at once and dress, and see what another
day had in store for him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE NEW CHAUFFEUR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the new arrival wandered up the street, and inspected
the village, he had been under the impression that the
place was deserted—he scarcely saw a soul; but this
was the way of Ottinge folk, they spent most of their
time (especially of an evening) indoors, and though
he was not aware of it, Ottinge had inspected him!
Girls sewing in windows, men lounging in the Drum,
women shutting up their fowl, all had noted the stranger,
and wondered who this fine, tall young gentleman might
be? An hour later they were amazed to learn that
he was no more and no less than the Parretts’ new
chauffeur, who was lodging with Sally Hogben—Sally,
who could talk faster and tell more about a person in
five minutes than another in twenty. This intelligence—which
spread as water in a sponge—created a profound
sensation, and shared the local interest with the news
of the sudden death of Farmer Dunk’s best cow.</p>

<p>The following morning it was the turn of the chauffeur
to be surprised. When he repaired to the Manor, to
report himself and ask for orders, he encountered Miss
Parrett herself in the hall, who informed him, in her
shrillest bleat, that as she did not propose to use the
car that day, and as there was nothing else for him to
do, he could put in his time by cleaning windows.
When Wynyard heard Miss Parrett’s order, his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
hardened, the colour mounted to his forehead, and he
was on the point of saying that he had been engaged as
chauffeur, and not as charwoman; but a sharp mental
whisper arrested the words on his lips:</p>

<p>“Are you going to throw up your situation within
twenty-four hours, and be back on Leila’s hands after
all the trouble she has taken for you?” demanded this
peremptory voice. “You must begin at the bottom
of the ladder if you want to get to the top. Let this
old woman have her own way, and bully you—and if
you take things quietly, and as they come, your affairs
will mend.”</p>

<p>After what seemed to Miss Parrett a most disrespectful
silence, during which she glared at Owen with
her little burning eyes, and mumbled with her toothless
jaws, he said slowly—</p>

<p>“All right, ma’am. I’ve never cleaned windows
yet, but I’ll do my best; perhaps you will give me
something to clean them with?”</p>

<p>“Go through that door and you will find the kitchen,”
said Miss Parrett. “The cook will give you cloths,
soap, and a bucket of water. You may begin in the
dining-room;” and pointing towards the servants’
quarters, she left him. As he disappeared, Susan, who
had overheard the last sentence, boldly remonstrated—</p>

<p>“Really, Bella, that young man is not supposed to
undertake such jobs! He was only engaged as chauffeur,
and I’m sure if you set him to do housework, he will
leave.”</p>

<p>“Let him, and mind your own business, Susan,”
snapped her sister. “He is in <i>my</i> employment, and I
cannot afford to pay him two guineas a week—six
shillings a day—for doing nothing. I am not a millionaire!
As it is, my hand is never out of my pocket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“But you engaged him to drive the car, and if you
are afraid to go out in it, is that his fault?” argued
Susan, with surprising courage.</p>

<p>“Who says I’m afraid?” demanded Miss Parrett
furiously. “Susan, you forget yourself. I shall have
the car to-morrow, and motor over to call on the
Woolcocks.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Owen passed into the back premises,
which were old and spacious. Here, in a vast kitchen
overlooking a great paved yard, he found a tall woman
engaged in violently raking out the range. She started
as he entered, and turned a handsome, ill-tempered face
upon him.</p>

<p>“Can you let me have some cloths and a bucket
of hot water?” he asked in his clear, well-bred voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she answered, going to a drawer. “What
sort of cloths—flannels or rubbers?”</p>

<p>“Something for cleaning windows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, laws, so you’re the new chauffeur! Well, I
never!” And, leaving the drawer open, she turned
abruptly, leant her back to the dresser, and surveyed
him exhaustively.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“And so that’s the sort of work the old devil has
set you to? Lady Kesters engaged me for this place,
and by all accounts she did the same kindness by you
and me! I understood as this was a proper establishment,
with a regular housekeeper and <i>men</i>—a butler
at least and a couple of footmen; there isn’t as much
as a page-boy. It’s a swindle! I suppose you take
your meals with us?” (Here, with an animated
gesture, she dismissed an inquisitive kitchen-maid.)</p>

<p>“No; I board myself.”</p>

<p>Her face fell. This good-looking chauffeur would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
be some one to flirt with, and her voice took a yet
sharper key.</p>

<p>“You’re from London, I can see, and so am I. Lord!
this is a change”—now casting herself into a chair.
“Ye see, I was ordered country air, and so I came—the
wages being fair, and assistance given; and thinking
we were in a park, I brought my bicycle, and expecting
there’d be some society, I brought a couple of ball-gowns,
and find this!” and her expression was tragic.</p>

<p>“Have you been here long?” he asked civilly.</p>

<p>“Two weeks too long. I give notice next day,
and am going at the month, and you won’t be long
after me, <i>I</i> bet! Do you bike?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered rather shortly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, you’ve the use of your legs! To-morrow
is my evening out, so you come round here at
five, and I’ll give you a nice cup o’ tea, and we’ll go
for a stroll together. We <i>ought</i> to be friendly, seeing
as we both come from Lady Kesters’ recommendation.”</p>

<p>To walk out with the cook! This was ten times
worse than window-cleaning! Wynyard was beating
his brain for some civil excuse when Miss Parrett
herself appeared in the doorway—an accusing and
alarming figure.</p>

<p>“This is a nice way you waste my time!” she
exclaimed, with an angry glance at both. “You and
cook gossiping together and idling. Where are the
cloths and the hot water, young man?”</p>

<p>The cook, grumbling audibly and insolently, went
back to the dresser, and Miss Parrett, with folded arms,
waited dramatically in the kitchen till Wynyard was
provided for. He then walked off with a brief “Thank
you” to his fellow-culprit. As he passed along the flagged
passage he caught Miss Parrett’s shrill voice saying—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Now, I’ll not have you flirting with that young
man, so I warn you! I’ll have no carryings-on in <i>my</i>
house.”</p>

<p>Then a door was slammed with thunderous violence,
and there was silence.</p>

<p>No, by Jove, he could not stand it, he said to himself
as he set down his bucket, and wrung out a cloth;
like the cook, he, too, would depart, and in his next
situation stipulate for no women. Of course Leila
would be disappointed, and he was sorry; but Leila
would never ask him to put up with <i>this</i>! He
would give a week’s notice and advertise; he had
enough money to keep him going for a while, and his
certificate.</p>

<p>Presently he set to work on the dining-room, where
there were three old casemented, mullioned windows;
to clean these he stood on the lawn, and had begun his
job when Miss Susan entered, smiling and radiating
good humour.</p>

<p>“I dare say you don’t know much about this sort
of work,” she began apologetically, “and I’ll just show
you! You have to use lots of clean water, and stand
outside on the lawn—no fear of breaking your neck.”
Then in another tone she added, “I’ll see you are not
asked to do this again; at present we are rather short-handed,
but by and by everything will go smoothly.”
She was about to add something more, when her sister
put her head in at the door, and called out—</p>

<p>“Now, do come away, Susan, and don’t stand gossiping
with the young man, and idling him at his work.
He has wasted half an hour with the cook already!”</p>

<p>Wynyard, as he rubbed away at the panes, whistled
gaily whilst his mind dwelt on many matters, amongst
others of how strange that he should be down in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
queer, God-forsaken village, living in a labourer’s cottage,
and employed in cleaning windows! Well, he had
Miss Susan’s word for it that he would not be asked to
do it again; she was a good sort, with a nice, cheery
face, and such a pair of twinkling blue eyes. Then he
thought of the tragic cook, also sent by Leila, and he
laughed aloud. The house wanted a lot of servants,
and as far as he could gather the staff was short-handed;
probably Miss Aurea would see to all this, since she
managed every one in Ottinge, did as she liked, and
was the prettiest girl within ten parishes!</p>

<p>Wynyard was a handy man, and got through his
work rapidly and well. He fetched many cans of
water, and presently moved on to the drawing-room—another
low room with heavily beamed ceiling and a
polished oak floor. The apartment was without carpet
or curtains, and scantily furnished with various old
chairs, settees and cabinets, ranged against the wall.
He was sitting outside on the sill, whistling under his
breath, polishing his last casement, when he heard,
through the half-open door, a clear young voice talking
with animation, and a girl came into the room laughing—followed
by an Aberdeen terrier on a leash. As she
advanced, he noticed that she had wild rose colouring,
wavy dark hair, merry dark eyes, and an expression of
radiant vitality. Tom was right! Here, no doubt, was
Miss Aurea, the prettiest girl in ten parishes!</p>

<p>As Wynyard looked again at this arresting vision
something strange seemed to stir in his heart and come
to life. First impressions have a value distinct from
the settled judgment of long experience.</p>

<p>“What a floor, Susie!” exclaimed the young lady.
“Really, we must get Aunt Bella to give a dance;”
and as she spoke she began to hum the “Merry Widow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Waltz,” and to execute some remarkably neat steps,
accompanied by the terrier, who struggled round in her
wake, barking indignantly.</p>

<p>“Mackenzie, you <i>are</i> an odious partner!” addressing
the animal; then to her aunt, “I’ve brought him on
the chain, and he has me on the chain; he is so strong!
We have accosted and insulted every single village dog,
and frightened Mrs. Watkins’ cats into hysterics! However,
he can’t get loose and murder poor gentlemanly
Joss! Oh, we little knew <i>what</i> we were doing when
we accepted Mac as a darling puppy!”</p>

<p>“I must confess that I never care for these aggressive,
stiff-necked Aberdeens, and I don’t pretend to like Mac.
To tell you the honest truth, I’m mortally afraid of him!”</p>

<p>“But he must be exercised, Susan. And now we
must exercise ourselves, and begin on this room. I’ve
sent over the curtains, and they are ready to go up.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she noticed the stranger, who was polishing
a distant window. “Why, I thought it was Hogben!”
she muttered. “Who is it, Susie?” and she looked
over at Wynyard with an air of puzzled interest.</p>

<p>“The new chauffeur, my dear,” was the triumphant
response. “He only came yesterday; his name is Owen.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the girl, turning her back to the
window and speaking in a low voice. “And didn’t he
<i>object</i>?”</p>

<p>“No; but I fancy he doesn’t like it. He seems a nice
civil young fellow. Lady Kesters found him for us.”</p>

<p>“Did she? I sincerely hope he is a better find
than the cook. What a fury! Even Aunt Bella is afraid
of her!”</p>

<p>“She has a splendid character from her late mistress.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, in order to pass her on at any price.
She’s a first-rate cook, but a regular demon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“My dear, they all have tempers—it’s the fire, poor
things. Now, about the chauffeur——”</p>

<p>At this moment the object of her conversation threw
up the sash and stepped into the room—a fine figure
in his clean blue shirt, turned up to the elbows, well-cut
breeches, and neat leather leggings.</p>

<p>“I’ve finished this room, miss,” he said, addressing
himself to Miss Susan. “What am I to do next?” and his
eyes rested upon her with respectful inquiry.</p>

<p>“No more windows to-day, thank you, Owen. I
expect it is nearly your dinner-hour.”</p>

<p>“Shall you require the car this afternoon, miss?”</p>

<p>“No; but it will certainly be wanted to-morrow,—eh,
Aurea?”</p>

<p>“Then I’d better take her out and give her a turn;”
and with this remark he picked up his bucket and rags,
and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>During this brief conversation, Aurea stood by listening
with all her ears, and making mental notes. Her
aunt’s new chauffeur, with his clean, tanned, high-bred
face, spoke like an educated man.</p>

<p>“My dear Susie,” she inquired, “where did Lady
Kesters get hold of such a superior person?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can’t tell you. She said she had known
his family all her life, and that they were most respectable
people. Chauffeurs are supposed to be smart, and well-groomed,
eh?”</p>

<p>Yes, but there was more than this about the late
window-cleaner—something in his gait, carriage, and
voice, and, unless she was greatly mistaken, the new
employé was a gentleman; but with unusual prudence
Aurea contrived to keep her suspicion to herself. Aloud
she said—</p>

<p>“Well, now, let us see about the carpet! This room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
ought to be settled at once—pictures up, and curtains;
there’s no place to ask visitors into, and you’ve been here
six months. You are lazy, Miss Susan Parrett—this <i>is</i>
sleepy hollow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear child, you know perfectly well it’s your
Aunt Bella; and she won’t make up her mind. What’s
done one day is taken down another. What <i>is</i> that awful
row?”</p>

<p>“It’s Mackenzie and Joss,” cried Aurea, dashing
towards the door. Mackenzie, at large and unnoticed,
had stealthily followed the chauffeur out of the room, and
stolen a march upon his deadly enemy—Miss Parrett’s
impudent and interloping mongrel. The result of this
dramatic meeting was a scene in the hall, where Miss
Parrett, mounted on a chair, looked on, uttering
breathless shrieks of “Aurea! Aurea! it’s all <i>your</i>
fault!” whilst round and round, and to and fro, raged
the infuriated animals, snarling and growling ferociously,
their teeth viciously fastened in each other’s flesh.</p>

<p>Mackenzie, the more experienced, able-bodied, and
malevolent of the two, had Joss by the throat—Joss, for his
part, was steadily chewing through Mackenzie’s fore-leg.</p>

<p>Here Wynyard came to the rescue, and, though
severely bitten, succeeded after some difficulty in separating
the combatants; he and Miss Aurea somehow
managed it between them, but he had borne the brunt
of the fray, the forefront of the battle.</p>

<p>A good deal of personal intimacy is involved in such
encounters, and by the time the panting Mackenzie was
hauled away by the collar, and the furious Joss had been
incarcerated in the dining-room, the new chauffeur and
Miss Morven were no longer strangers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>AS HANDY MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chauffeur was informed that there were no orders
for the car the following morning, as “Miss Parrett was
suffering from neuralgia in her face,” and also—though
this was not mentioned in the bulletin—a sharp pain in
her temper.</p>

<p>Aurea, an early visitor, radiating gaiety, was on this
occasion unaccompanied by Mackenzie. Mackenzie,
aged six years, was the village tyrant and dictator. He
also had been accustomed to consider himself a dog of
two houses—the Rectory and the Red Cottage; and
when the Red Cottage had moved to the Manor, and
installed an animal of low degree as its pet, he was naturally
filled with wrath and resentment, and on two opportunities
the intruder had narrowly escaped with many
deep bites, and his life!</p>

<p>Aurea found her Aunt Bella trotting about the
premises and passages, with the knitted hood over her
head, and key-basket in hand.</p>

<p>“Not going out to-day!” she exclaimed; “but it’s
lovely, Aunt Bella. The air is so deliciously soft—it
would do you no end of good.”</p>

<p>“My dear Aurea,” she piped, “I know you don’t
allow any one in Ottinge to call their soul their own, and
I must ask you to leave <i>me</i> my body, and to be the best
judge of my ailments—and state of health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Oh, I beg your pardon, Aunt Bella; I meant no
harm. Well, then, if you are not going to use the car
yourself, perhaps Susan and I could take it over to Westmere?
The Woolcocks have a large house-party, and
Joey and her husband are there.”</p>

<p>Miss Parrett closed her eyes tightly—a sure hoisting
of the storm cone—and screwed up her little old face till
it resembled an over-ripe cream cheese.</p>

<p>“<i>Really</i>, Aurea! I don’t know what the world is
coming to! How dare you propose such a thing! Take
out my car for the first time without <i>me</i>! But, of course,
I know I’m only a cipher in my own house!”—an almost
hourly complaint.</p>

<p>“But do think of the chauffeur, Aunt Bella; is he
to have nothing to do?” Here this crafty girl touched
a sensitive nerve—a responsive key.</p>

<p>“Plenty for him to do; there’s enough work in the
house for twenty chauffeurs: unpacking the book boxes
and china—never opened since your grandfather’s death—staining
the floors, and putting up the curtains, and
laying carpets. If you and Susan <i>are</i> going to settle the
drawing-room at last, he may help you. I can’t spare
Jones or Hogben from the garden.”</p>

<p>“Very well, we must have some one to lift the heavy
things, and stand on ladders. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Outside in the hall, awaiting my orders,” replied
Miss Parrett, with magnificent dignity, folding her hands
over what had once been a neat waist, but now measured
thirty inches.</p>

<p>Yes, the chauffeur was in the hall, cap in hand,
attended by the grateful Joss, and had overheard the
foregoing conversation.</p>

<p>Miss Parrett came forth as she concluded her speech,
and issued her commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Owen, you are to help my sister and Miss Morven in
settling the drawing-room. Be careful how you handle
things, and don’t break anything; and you may have
your dinner here for to-day, with the other servants.”</p>

<p>“Very good, ma’am,” he assented.</p>

<p>But with respect to dinner with the servants, it was
really very <i>bad</i>. He would be compelled to fence with
the London cook, and keep her and her civil proposals
at arm’s length—no easy job!</p>

<p>From ten o’clock till half-past one, Wynyard spent an
agreeable and busy time in the service of Miss Susan and
her niece. His boast to his sister that he was “clever
with his hands” was fully justified. He hung the chintz
and white curtains with the skill of an upholsterer, he
laid the dark blue felt on the floor, stretched it and nailed
it neatly in its place, whilst Aurea stood by, and gave
directions, and sometimes—such was her zeal—went
down on her knees beside him, and pulled and dragged
too, exertions which enabled her associate to realise the
perfect curve of cheek and neck, and the faint perfume
of her glorious hair!</p>

<p>And all this time industrious Miss Susan sewed on
rings, fitted loose chintz covers, and talked incessantly.
She did not appear to find the presence of the chauffeur
the slightest restraint—indeed, he was so quiet and kept
his personality so steadily in the background, that as
aunt and niece chatted and conferred, measured and
altered, they seemed to have entirely forgotten his
existence, and as the old drawing-room was full of nooks,
angles, and deep windows, he was not only out of mind,
but also out of sight. Meanwhile, he enjoyed the rôle of
audience, especially in listening to Miss Aurea! What
a gay, light-hearted girl! And in her playful arguments
with her aunt, he realised the delightful camaraderie that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
existed between them. Her chaff was so amusing that,
although he was not included in the conversation, he
often felt inclined to echo Miss Susan’s appreciative
laugh. Never had he come across any one who had
attracted him so much; the more he saw of Miss Morven
the more he admired her! Possibly this was because for
the last twelve months he had not been brought in
contact with a happy, high-spirited English girl—or
was it because in this out-of-the-world village he had
met his fate?</p>

<p>As Wynyard hung curtains, and put in screws, he
stole swift glances at Miss Susan’s busy helper, noticed
her slim elegance, her infectious smile, and lovely face.
It was a ridiculous, but absolutely true fact, that to see
a really beautiful, charming, and unaffected girl, one
must come to Ottinge-in-the-Marsh!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as he worked in the background, he
gathered up many crumbs of conversation, and scraps of
family and local news. He learned that Mr. Morven’s
great work on <i>The Mithraic Heresy and Its Oriental Origin</i>
was nearly complete, that the Manor cook had given
notice, and that no one had rented the fishing.</p>

<p>“The Woolcocks have a houseful at Westmere,” so
said Miss Susan, “and their staff of servants had recently
enjoyed a sensational turning out. Joey Waring and
her husband are there, just back from their winter trip.”</p>

<p>“And how is Joe?” inquired Aurea.</p>

<p>“Her hair is twice as fluffy, and she is louder, noisier,
and talks ten times more than ever!”</p>

<p>“Now, Susan, you know that is impossible!”</p>

<p>“Yes; Kathleen declares that you can hear her laugh
as you pass the park gates.”</p>

<p>“What! a whole mile away! She must have mistaken
one of the peacocks for Joey, and however loud she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
laughs and talks, she never says an unkind word of any
one.”</p>

<p>“No, a good, kind little soul! but I wonder Captain
Waring can stand her, and her chatter does not drive
him crazy.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, he adores her, and is enormously
proud of her flow of animation and conversation. You
see, he is so silent himself, Joey is his antithesis; and
Joey is worshipped at home, for in a family of large,
heavy, silent people, a little gabbling creature is appreciated.
Tell me about Kathleen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kathleen is, as usual, very busy and cheery; she
has three new boarders—hungry and quarrelsome.”</p>

<p>“And he?”</p>

<p>“Just as usual too, dear. You know he never can be
better.”</p>

<p>“But he may grow worse!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t speak of such a thing! Think of Kathleen.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I think Kathleen is a saint—so brave and
unselfish. Now, where shall we put the old Palairet
mirrors?”</p>

<p>“You had better consult your Aunt Bella.”</p>

<p>“My dear, good Susan!” (This was the style in
which she addressed her relative.) “Don’t you know
your own sister by this time? She has been here nearly
seven months, and you are not half settled yet—only
bedrooms and dining-room—and I have undertaken to
help you finish off in three days.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s nonsense, though I must say you’ve
worked miracles this morning—curtains, covers, carpet;
but there was no question of where they had to go. As
to pictures, mirrors, and cabinets, it will take your aunt
a twelvemonth to decide how to place them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“I shall decide, and place them to-day,” rejoined the
girl, with calm decision; “if I ask Aunt Bella, they will be
tried on every wall, till our backs are broken, and then
taken down after all. The round glass between the
windows,”—looking about and speaking with authority—“the
other over the mantelpiece, the Chinese cabinet in
that niche—they are just made for one another—the
Charles the First black bureau from the schoolroom just
here, and the screen from her bedroom by the door.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, you”—and she broke into a laugh—“you
wouldn’t <i>dare</i>!”</p>

<p>“Would I not? Just wait and see. The room is
charming, and when it’s finished Auntie B. will be enchanted!
You may leave her to me. Oh,” in another
tone to Wynyard, who had come forward in search of
some wire, “you <i>have</i> worked well. It must be your
dinner-hour. We shall be ready to start again at half-past
two o’clock, and then the parlour-maid will help you
with the furniture.”</p>

<p>“Very well, miss,” he answered.</p>

<p>As Aurea walked off, followed by Miss Susan, Wynyard
the imposter assured himself that Miss Morven was
quicker witted than her aunts. He had noticed her expression
of keen attention as he discussed a matter of a
curtain pole with her relative, and it was quite possible
that she already had an inkling of the truth! He must
be careful and wary not to give himself away or utter a
word beyond “Yes, miss,” and “No, miss.” He was
already attending closely to the speech of Tom Hogben,
and had marked the scantiness and laziness of his vocabulary;
how he never said more than he could help, and
used the words, “Sure-ly,” and “I dunno,” and “ye
see,” and “’ee” for “he,” and “I be” for “I am,” and
resolved to imitate him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>The meal in the servants’ hall proved an even more
trying ordeal than he anticipated, and was altogether so
disagreeable to the new chauffeur that, sooner than face
it again, he determined to fast.</p>

<p>The London cook (Miss Hicks) and four maids were
present, also the boot-boy—a clumsy yokel, who was in
terrified attendance. Owen sat on Miss Hicks’ right
hand, and received all her attention, the best helpings,
and daintiest morsels of a solid and satisfying
meal.</p>

<p>She would scarcely suffer the other servants to address
him, though the rosy-cheeked parlour-maid made bold
and even desperate attempts. She plied him with
questions, compliments, and information. For his part,
he proved a disappointing guest, and did not afford Miss
Hicks much satisfaction; she came to the conclusion
that in spite of his fine figure and good looks the chauffeur
was a dull sort of chap, and terribly backward at taking
a hint. When she nudged him with her elbow, and
pressed his foot under the table, there was no response—in
fact, he moved a bit away! However, she laid the
flattering unction to her soul that the poor fellow was <i>shy</i>.
He was duly favoured with the cook’s candid opinion of
the place and their employers, namely, that Miss P. was
an old terror, was a shocking one for running after lords
and ladies, and talking grand, yet that mean and sneaking
she would frighten you! She and Miss Norris, housekeeper
at the Rectory, were cuts, only for the Rector; anyway,
Norris never came to the Manor. Miss Susan was a lady,
but a giddy old thing, so fond of gadding and amusement,
and laws! what a one to talk! As for Miss Aurea——</p>

<p>No, he could not sit by and hear Miss Aurea dissected,
and with an excuse that he wanted to have a pipe before
he went back to his job, the chauffeur pushed away his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
unfinished cheese, and with a civil farewell took his
departure.</p>

<p>The afternoon was a busy one: the mirrors were put
up, pictures were hung, but with many incursions and
interruptions from Miss Parrett. Joss, the dog, was also
in and out, and seemed inclined to attach himself to
Wynyard.</p>

<p>Miss Parrett, still hooded, sat upright in an arm-chair,
offering irritating criticisms, and quarrelling
vigorously as to the position of pictures and articles
of furniture; the old lady was altogether extremely
troublesome and argumentative, and gave double work.
Thoroughly alive to the fact that her niece had good
taste, she was jealous of her activities, and yet wished
to see the old rooms arranged to the best advantage—as
the result would redound to her personal credit.</p>

<p>It was an immense relief to the three harassed
workers when the parlour-maid entered and announced—</p>

<p>“If you please, Miss Parrett, Lady Mary Cooper has
called, and I’ve shown her into the study.”</p>

<p>“You mean the library,” corrected her mistress. “Say
I’m coming;” and she trotted over to a glass, removed
her hood, and called upon Aurea to arrange her cap.</p>

<p>“Time Lady Mary <i>did</i> call!” she grumbled. “We
are here seven months.”</p>

<p>“She has been abroad,” said Susan; “and, anyway,
she’s not much of a visitor.”</p>

<p>“Well, she is our own cousin, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Our cousin—Lady Mary!” repeated Miss Susan. “I
do declare, Bella, you have a craze for cousins. Why, we
scarcely know the woman!”</p>

<p>“Now, Susan, don’t argue! She <i>is</i> our relative;
her great-great-aunt married a Davenant, and I suppose
you will allow that they are our kin? I have no time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to explain now;” and she pattered off, abandoning the
workers to their own devices.</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Bella is so funny about relations! People
I’ve never heard of she will say are our own cousins.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to the tenth generation,” agreed Aurea, “if
they are well born. Aunt Bella has pedigree on the
brain—for myself, I think it a bore.”</p>

<p>It was strange that Miss Parrett, who, on her mother’s
side, was the granddaughter of a rough Hoogly pilot,
should be as haughty and exclusive as if she were an
Austrian princess. In the neighbourhood it had become
a well-established joke that, if any one of importance and
old family was mentioned before Miss Parrett, she was
almost sure to announce—</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know much about them personally,
but they are our cousins!”</p>

<p>By six o’clock the task of arranging the drawing-room
was completed. Wynyard had been assisted by
the rosy-cheeked maid in bringing tables, cabinets, and
china from other rooms, and they really had, as Miss
Susan declared, “worked like blacks.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a dear old room!” said Aurea, surveying the
apartment with unconcealed complacency. “When the
bowls are filled with flowers, and we have a bridge table,
and a jigsaw puzzle, we shall be perfect—old-fashioned,
and in the fashion.”</p>

<p>“Glad you think so!” said a little bleating voice in
the doorway. “Lady Mary asked for you, Susan, and I
told her you were out, or she’d have wanted to come
poking in here. So”—looking about—“you’ve brought
the black cabinet out of the schoolroom! Who gave you
leave to do that? And”—she threw out a quivering forefinger—“the
blue china bowls from the spare room, and
<i>my</i> screen! You take too much upon yourself, Aurea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Morven! You should have consulted me. I am tired of
telling you that I will <i>not</i> be a cipher in my own house!”</p>

<p>Aurea coloured vividly. Did her aunt forget that the
chauffeur was present? Really, Aunt Bella was too bad.
She glanced at the young man, who was standing on
the steps straightening a picture; apparently he was
absorbed in his task, and to all appearances had not
heard the recent conversation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry you don’t like the room, Aunt
Bella!” said Aurea, seating herself in a high old chair,
crossing her neat feet, and folding her hands.</p>

<p>“Sorry!”—and Miss Parrett sniffed—“that’s what
you always say!”</p>

<p>“Now, my dear, please don’t be so cross,” she replied,
unabashed; “you know, in your heart, you are delighted,
and as proud of this drawing-room as a peacock with
two tails.”</p>

<p>“<i>Aurea!</i>” shrieked her aunt.</p>

<p>“You have been here seven months, and you’ve not
a single place in which to receive visitors. Look, now,
at Lady Mary—you had her in the musty old study—and
why?”—waving an interrogative hand—“simply because
for months you could not make up your mind about the
arrangement of this room. All the county have called—the
first calls—and carried off the first impressions.
None of your lovely old things were to be seen, but
waiting to be settled.”</p>

<p>“Aurea, I will not suffer——”</p>

<p>“Please do let me finish, dear. Before I left, you
may remember how you and I talked it all over—cabinets,
china, sofas—and settled exactly where everything was to
fit. I come back at the end of a month and I find nothing
done; so I’ve made up my mind to work here for several
days. I’ve asked the padré to spare me. This room is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
finished, and looks extremely nice; the next I take in
hand will be the den! Now, as it’s after six o’clock,
I’m afraid I must be off;” and she arose, stooped down,
and kissed her aunt on the forehead, adding—</p>

<p>“Of course I know, dear, that you are immensely
obliged to me, and so you need not say anything. Good-bye—good-bye,
Susie,” waving her hand, and she was
gone, leaving Miss Parrett in the middle of the room
temporarily speechless.</p>

<p>“Well—up—on my word!” and she took a long
breath.</p>

<p>“After all, Bella, Aurea has made the room perfectly
charming,” said Miss Susan, with unusual courage. “It’s
the prettiest in the whole neighbourhood; the old things
never were half seen before. She sewed the curtains
herself, and, until to-day, we’ve never had any decent
place to ask visitors to sit down in.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, it’s all very well, but if she hadn’t my
nice old things to work with, she couldn’t have made up
such a room. Yes, I’m always just—every one says my
sense of justice is my strong point—and I admit that she
helped; what I object to is Aurea’s way—her way,” she
repeated, “of just doing exactly whatever she chooses,
and smiling in your face. She leads the whole of Ottinge
by the nose, from the parson, her father, down to Crazy
Billy.” And Wynyard, who was listening to this declaration,
told himself that he was not surprised.</p>

<p>Miss Parrett was not particularly attached to her
niece, although she was by no means indifferent to her
fascinating personality, and a sunny face that brought
light and gaiety into the house; but this wizened old
woman of seventy-four grudged the girl her youth, and
was animated by the natural antagonism of one who has
lived, towards one who has life before her!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE TRIAL TRIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last, with considerable pomp and circumstance, after
a whole week of procrastination, Miss Parrett ventured
to inaugurate her motor.</p>

<p>She appeared in a long fur cloak and gigantic sable
stole—a shapeless bundle, resembling a well-to-do bear,
with a cross human face. Susan, who, after all, was but
fifty, looked unusually trim and young in a neat tailor-made,
and becoming toque, whilst Aurea—who had been
permitted to share in the triumph—was so pretty herself,
that one scarcely noticed what she wore, merely that she
exercised marvellous dexterity in the matter of introducing
a large black hat into the interior of the car.</p>

<p>The household were collected for this supreme event:
the cook, scowling and scornful, three maids, Hogben,
Jones the head gardener, and the boot-boy, all assembled
to witness the start—even Joss was in attendance. The
motor (in truth a whited sepulchre) had been recently
done up, and with its good-looking driver in smart
leather coat and cap, presented an imposing appearance
as it sped down the drive.</p>

<p>Miss Parrett closed her eyes, and when it swung out
of the gate with a slight lurch, she gave a loud scream,
but as it glided up the street, and she noticed that all
eyes were on her car (there was Mrs. Ramsay at her
door, and the doctor’s wife too), she became comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
composed. At the gate of the Rectory the Rector
awaited the great sight, and waved a valedictory stick;
then they sped along easily, and, being now out of the
village, Wynyard put on the second speed, but was
instantly arrested by Miss Parrett’s protesting cries.</p>

<p>“Tell him to stop!” she called to her sister. “Supposing
we met something. There!” as they passed the
local carrier’s cart within three yards.</p>

<p>“Owen, you are not to go so fast!” commanded
Susan. “Miss Parrett is nervous.”</p>

<p>He obediently slowed down to eight miles an hour, and
as the old machine joggled along, bumping and shaking,
the window-glasses rattling, the chauffeur was conscious
of a feeling of angry contempt, instead of the usual
partiality which a driver reserves for his own car. He
had heard that a driver should be in tune with his machine,
but how could any sane man be in sympathy with this
bone-shaker? He was confident that after a long
journey, or any extra strain, the old thing would collapse
and fall to pieces.</p>

<p>After many directions, and not one poor little adventure,
they entered a long avenue leading to an imposing
Tudor house with picturesque chimney-stacks, situated
in a great park. This was once the family seat of the
Davenants—cousins of the Wynyards; and as she saw
the end of her journey, Miss Parrett’s courage mounted.
When the car was crawling, or, better still, at a full
stop, she was extremely fond of motoring and not the
least nervous.</p>

<p>As the visitors approached the hall door, they overtook
a large and lively house-party, who were returning
from the golf links to tea. They included Mr. Woolcock—a
burly figure in knickerbockers, and brilliant stockings,—his
vivacious married daughter, Mrs. Wade Waring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
commonly known as “Joey,” her husband, and half a
dozen guests—altogether a smart and cheerful crowd.</p>

<p>After the first noisy greetings had subsided, Mrs.
Waring seized upon Aurea; she, to use her own expression,
“<i>adored</i> the girl.” Aurea Morven was so pretty to
look at, so gay, and so natural, it was a sin to have her
buried in Ottinge; and she secretly designed her for her
future sister-in-law. Aurea was just the wife for Bertie.
He was heavy, dull, and stodgy—a complete contrast
to herself, with her animated face, lively gestures, wiry
figure, and ceaseless flow of chatter.</p>

<p>As, arm in arm, she was conducting her friend indoors,
she halted for a moment to look back.</p>

<p>“So that’s the wonderful new motor!” she exclaimed
dramatically. “I say, where did you find such a tophole
chauffeur? Why,” she screamed, “I know him! It’s
<i>Owen</i>; he was a saloon steward on the <i>Anaconda</i>!” and
Wynyard, seeing that he was recognised, made a virtue
of necessity, and touched his cap.</p>

<p>“Why, Owen,” hastily descending the steps as she
spoke, “fancy you on dry land! So you’ve given up
the sea, and taken to a new trade. How do you like it?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, thank you, ma’am,” he answered, with
an impassive face.</p>

<p>“I hope you got the beautiful white-covered umbrella
I left for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid the stewardess might bag it! I
thought it would be useful to you in Buenos Ayres, when
you were walking in the Calle Florida with your best
girl!” and she surveyed him with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Joey!” expostulated her father;
“you are blocking up the gangway, and we all want
our tea. Let the man take his car round.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“But only think, dad, he was my pet steward
coming home,” declared his lively daughter; “on rough
days he brought me chicken broth on deck, and was <i>so</i>
sympathetic—just a ministering angel! Toby will tell
you what a treasure he was, too. He always had a match
on him, always knew the time, and the run, and was the
best hand to tuck a rug round me I <i>ever</i> knew!”</p>

<p>Long before the conclusion of this superb eulogy,
(delivered in a high-pitched voice from the steps), its
subject had found a refuge in the yard.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it extraordinary how one comes across
people?” continued Joey, as she led Aurea indoors.
“Fancy your chauffeur being one of the stewards on
the <i>Anaconda</i>!”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say about my chauffeur?”
demanded Miss Parrett, with arrogant solemnity, who
had been a disapproving witness of the recent scene.
(She considered Joey Waring a shockingly fast, vulgar
little person, who absorbed far too much of the general
conversation and attention; but as she was the wife of a
wealthy man, and the sister of a notable <i>parti</i>, she dissembled
her dislike, or believed she did. But Joey was
aware that the eldest “Polly” considered her a terribly
inferior, frivolous sort of person.)</p>

<p>“I’m only saying how odd it is to find a steward
turned into a chauffeur! I do hope he is experienced,
dear Miss Parrett, and that he won’t bring you or the car
to grief. I call him quite dangerously good-looking, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>To this preposterous question Miss Parrett made no
reply, merely squeezed up her eyes, tossed her head, and
as she followed Mrs. Woolcock into the drawing-room
her feathers were still quivering.</p>

<p>After tea Mrs. Waring carried Aurea off to her room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
to enjoy a good gossip, and to exhibit some of the
treasures she had collected during her recent trip. Joey
and her husband were enterprising travellers; he, a big,
silent man—the opposite of his lively little wife—was
also a mighty sportsman.</p>

<p>“Now, let me hear what you have been doing with
yourself, Aurea,” said the lady, after a long and animated
description of her own experiences in the West Indies and
Buenos Ayres. “You have been up in town, I know. Do
tell me all about your love-affairs—I know they are legion.
Do confide in little Joey!”</p>

<p>“My love-affairs!” and the girl laughed. “I have
none; and if I had, Joey, you are about the worst
confidante I could find. All particulars would be given
out no later than at dinner to-night, and you’d put my
most heart-breaking experience in such a light, that
every one would be shrieking with laughter.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, you are heart-whole so far, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think I may admit that.”</p>

<p>“And so your Aunt Bella has set up a motor; what
possessed her?” And she stared into the girl’s face,
with a pair of knowing, light grey eyes. “She’s as
nervous as a cat!”</p>

<p>“Aunt Bella was possessed by the spirit of contradiction.
And, talking of the car, do tell me some
more about the chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“Or the waiter that was,” lighting another cigarette.
“He was awfully quick and civil; every one liked Owen.”</p>

<p>“Did it strike you, Joey, that he was something
above his class—er—in fact, a gentleman?” And as
Aurea asked the question she coloured faintly.</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” rejoined her friend, with decision.
“I have not a scrap of imagination, or an ounce of
romance in my composition. Such an idea never dawned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
on me. You see, Toby and I go about the world so
much; although we have two big houses, we almost
live in hotels, and I am accustomed to being served
by men with nice voices and agreeable manners, who
speak several foreign languages. <i>So</i> sorry to dispel
your illusions, but Owen waited to the manner born.
He may have been trained in some big house, and been
a gentleman’s gentleman. I fancy he is a roving
character. I think some one said he had been on a
ranch up-country.”</p>

<p>Aurea looked out of the window, and was silent.
Joey knew the world, and Joey, for all her free-and-easy
ways and her noisy manners, was <i>au fond</i> a sensible,
practical, little person.</p>

<p>“I dare say you are right, Joey,” she remarked at last.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I am! I grant you that the man
is rather an unusual type of chauffeur, to come down to a
dull situation in a dull little village; but, for goodness’
sake, don’t run away with the idea that he is some
swell in disguise, for he is <i>not</i>; he is just ‘off the cab
rank’—no more and no less. I admit his good looks,
but that’s nothing. One of the handsomest young men
I ever saw was a London carriage groom. I give you
my word, his eyelashes were half an inch long! In
these days, too, there are such hideous scandals about
women and their smart chauffeurs, that one cannot be
too reserved or too careful.”</p>

<p>“Joey!” cried Aurea, turning on her with a crimson
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not thinking of you, darling; you are as
cold and austere as Diana herself. I do wish you were
not so icy to some one—you know who I mean.”</p>

<p>But Aurea’s expression was not encouraging, and
her vivacious companion continued—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Isn’t this a darling old place?” rising and looking
over the Italian gardens and sloping lawns. “Somehow
I always feel sorry for those Davenants, and as if
we had no business here, and it was still theirs. We
have their heirlooms too—the Davenants’ Vandyke,
the lacquered cabinets, the Chippendale chairs. Dad
bought them, as they matched the place; but <i>we</i> don’t
fit in. Dad and mum were far happier in London; keeping
up a great estate and a great position is an awful
strain when one was not caught young. Do you know,
the servants are a frightful trial; they find the country
dull. And at the last ball we had, nearly all the hired
waiters were intoxicated; they drank most of the champagne,
and one of them handed a lemonade to Lord
Mottisfont, and said there was no fiz left! The mum
was so mortified she wept, poor dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, everything always seems to go smoothly,
quite London fashion, and without a hitch,” said Aurea
consolingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not behind the scenes; and the Mum
sometimes makes such horrible blunders in etiquette,
such as sending in a baronet’s wife before a countess—and
the countess looked pea-green! Altogether it’s a
fag. When Bertie marries I expect pater will make him
over the place. I wouldn’t mind reigning here myself—would
you, Aurea?”</p>

<p>“What a silly question, Joey! I’m not cut out for
reigning anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Only in people’s hearts, eh?” stroking her cheek
with a finger. “Isn’t that a pretty speech? Well,
come along, I want to show you the pretty things I
collected abroad—my fans and lace and embroideries.”</p>

<p>But just at this moment a maid entered, and said—</p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am, I was to say that Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Parrett’s car is at the door, and she’s waiting for Miss
Morven.”</p>

<p>The drive home was made by another road (in spite
of Miss Parrett’s querulous protestations, and it was
evident that the sooner she could abandon the motor
the better she would be pleased). Susan, on the other
hand, was anxious to see more of the country, and make
a detour round by a little town, eight miles away.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s nothing,” she protested; “it’s not
worth taking out the car for a run over to Westmere—one
might as well walk!”</p>

<p>“One would think it was <i>your</i> car, to hear you talking,
Susan;” and Miss Parrett threw herself back in the
corner, and closed her eyes, only to open them again
immediately, as they sped along the empty, country
roads between hedges already green.</p>

<p>“There’s Hopfield Hill!” she exclaimed, suddenly
sitting bolt upright. “I’m not going down that in a
motor, so don’t suppose it, either of you.”</p>

<p>“But it’s three-quarters of a mile long, and you
have a blister on your heel,” expostulated her sister.
“Come, Bella, don’t be foolish.”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i> argue; if it was twenty miles I’d walk it.
This thing gives me palpitation as it is.”</p>

<p>In spite of Aurea’s and Miss Susan’s prayers, vows,
and assurances, Miss Parrett descended at the top of a
long hill, insisted that her companions should accompany
her, and together the trio tramped down in the
mud, whilst the chauffeur sped along merrily, and awaited
them at the base. On their way home by a narrow
byroad they nearly met with a nasty accident. A cart,
drawn by a young horse, was coming out of a gate as the
motor approached, and there was an exciting scene.
The boy who was driving lost his head, the horse reared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and plunged, Miss Parrett shrieked, and the motor—which
was jammed into the bank—shuddered all over;
but, after a moment—a critical moment—all was well—all
but Miss Parrett, who collapsed into her corner, and
announced that she had spasms of the heart, and was
dying!</p>

<p>Ultimately they reached the Manor without further
trouble; the dying lady was restored with brandy and
water, and Owen the chauffeur spent the next two hours
in cleaning the muddy car. This was the part of the job
he loathed. Just as he had completed his task, he beheld,
to his discomfiture, the cook stepping delicately across
the yard, carrying a black bottle in one hand, and a wineglass
in the other.</p>

<p>“Good-evening to you, Mr. Owen. My word! you
do look hot after all your fag with the car. Beastly work,
ain’t it? I’ve just run over with a glass of ginger wine—it’s
my own.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Hicks. It’s awfully good of you,
but it’s a thing I never touch,” he answered politely.</p>

<p>“Then what do you say to a pint o’ beer, or a cup o’
tea?”</p>

<p>“No—er—I’m about done,” pulling down his sleeves;
“and I’m going.”</p>

<p>“The old girl seems a bit upset,” remarked the cook,
who had come out for conversation; “she’s awful
frightened of the car.”</p>

<p>“She needn’t be,” he answered shortly.</p>

<p>“Not with <i>you</i> a-driving, I’m sure, Mr. Owen. I
wish I could have a run in it, eh? There was a chauffeur
as I knew in London—rather a pal of mine—that used to
give his friends fine drives, as much as down to Brighton,
when the family was out of town. He were a treat, I can
tell you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Was he? I’d say he was a thief—unless he used
his own petrol.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, you’re mighty strict and proper, I
can see. Chapel, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No; you’re wrong there.”</p>

<p>“Look here, what’s the use of being so stand-off and
so stiff—it’s downright <i>silly</i>; you and me, as it were,
coming to this cruel place from the same reference.
Won’t you call round and take me for a nice walk on
Sunday afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No; you’re very kind—but I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why, what else have you to do?” her eyes kindling.
What else had he to do? Lie on his bed and smoke, and
read Leila’s papers. And there were other alternatives;
he could take a long stretch, say ten miles out and back, or
he might go to evening service and gaze at Aurea Morven!</p>

<p>“My word! you are a stupid!” declared Miss Hicks;
“even if you have a young woman up in town, she won’t
mind. <i>Have</i> you a young lady?” and her bold eyes were
searching.</p>

<p>Had he? He had! His young lady was Miss Aurea,
her mistress’s niece—Aurea or no other; and as he put
on his coat he looked his tormentor steadily in the face
and answered—</p>

<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s it! I see! And you’re hurrying off
to write to her? Well,”—spitefully—“I can tell you one
thing for yer comfort, there’s no post out of Ottinge
before Monday morning!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there? That’s a pity. Well, good-evening to
you, Miss Hicks;” and he walked off, leaving Miss Hicks
gaping after him. She, however, consoled herself with a
couple of glasses of ginger wine, before re-entering the
house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE DOGS’ HOTEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning succeeding the motor’s first trip proved
depressingly wet; thick mists of cold spring rain shrouded
the outlook from the Manor, beat down upon the pleasure
ground, and made pools in the hollows of the drive.</p>

<p>Miss Parrett, who was, as the servants expressed it,
“dodging” in and out of the sitting-room, issuing commands
and then withdrawing them, fastened upon the
chauffeur the moment he came for orders.</p>

<p>No, the car would not be required, and he could go
some errands into the village.</p>

<p>“Mind you don’t go loitering and gossiping,” she
added. “I know your sort, chattering with the maids.
Remember that your time belongs to me;” and she
pointed a stumpy forefinger at her knitted jacket. “I’ve
a note for Miss Morven at the Rectory, and another for
Ivy House, and I want some things at Topham’s shop.
I’ll give you a list. You can go into the schoolroom and
wait.”</p>

<p>Calm with excessive rage Wynyard entered the schoolroom,
where he found Miss Susan with a handkerchief
tied over her head, and an apron over her dress, unpacking
dusty china from a battered case.</p>

<p>“Such a day!” she exclaimed cheerfully; “and they
say it’s going to last—so we shall be very busy, and make
use of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“All right, miss,” he assented shortly; the accusation
of “chattering with maids” still left its sting.</p>

<p>“We are going to get up the cases of old books and
china, and unpack them here. The carpenter is putting
shelves in the library; but he is such a lazy fellow, I don’t
expect he will come out in this weather.”</p>

<p>“There you are as usual, Susan, talking and idling
people,” said her sister, entering with two notes and
a list; and in another moment Wynyard had been
dispatched.</p>

<p>First of all he went to the Rectory, and here the door
was opened by Mr. Morven himself, attended by Mackenzie,
who immediately stiffened from head to tail, and
growled round the chauffeur’s legs, evidently recognising
in him the ally of his mortal foe. Mr. Morven was a
squarely built elderly man with a grey beard, a benevolent
expression, and the eyes of the dreamer.</p>

<p>As he took the note he glanced at the messenger, and
his eyes dilated with the intentness of a surprised stare.
Wynyard’s type was not common in the parish; somehow
Mrs. Hogben’s lodger did not correspond with his
surroundings.</p>

<p>“I see this is for my daughter,” he said, and beckoning
to a parlour-maid he handed it to her. “Just come
into my study, will you, till the answer is written,” leading
the way across a wide hall panelled in oak. Through an
open door Wynyard caught a glimpse of the drawing-room,
and was conscious of a faded carpet, fresh chintz,
books, old china, a glowing fire, and a fragrant atmosphere.
The general impression of the Rectory, with its
oaken staircase, family portraits, and bowls of potpourri,
was delightful but fleeting; it seemed a peaceful, flower-scented
old house, of spotless neatness.</p>

<p>“You’re a newcomer, I believe?” said the Rector,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
preceding him into a room lined with books from floor to
ceiling, and seating himself at a writing-table. “Miss
Parrett’s chauffeur?” and he smiled to himself at some
reminiscence. “I see they are making use of you.
Church of England?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“If you have any sort of voice—tenor, baritone, or
bass—we shall be glad to have you in the choir; our tenor
is getting on; he must be close on seventy.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m not much good, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t sing, you look like a cricketer, eh?
I must get something out of you, you know;” and he
laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I can play cricket all right.”</p>

<p>“If you can bowl a bit, with Miss Parrett’s leave, I’ll
put you into the village club; we rather fancy ourselves,
and a young man of your stamp will be an acquisition.”
At this moment Aurea entered, carrying an enormous
cardboard box.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” she said. “I see aunt sent you for
the lampshade, and here it is.”</p>

<p>“What a size!” exclaimed her father. “Why, you
must have robbed your best hat! I declare it’s not
fair to a man to ask him to be seen with such a thing
going through the village.”</p>

<p>“Not half so bad as seeing people go down the street
with a black bottle in either hand!” retorted his daughter.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind, sir,” said Wynyard, taking up the
box as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Please tell Aunt Bella I will be after you in two or
three minutes,” said Aurea; then to her father, “She
wants to unpack grandpapa’s books at last!”</p>

<p>“You mean that she wants you to unpack the books,”
corrected Mr. Morven; “you might steal a few for me, eh?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
I suppose you will be away all day?” and he looked at
her rather wistfully.</p>

<p>“No, no, dear, I’ll be back soon after tea.” To Owen:
“Straight on, it’s an easy door.”</p>

<p>As Wynyard turned in the hall and backed out, box in
hand, he had a vision of pretty Miss Aurea perched on the
arm of his chair, with her arm round her father’s neck.
Lucky old beggar!</p>

<p>His next errand was to the shop—Topham’s—and as
he lingered irresolutely in the rain, staring up and down
the street, he was overtaken by a brisk figure in an aquascutum
and motor cap.</p>

<p>“I see you are searching for our emporium,” she
began, “and I’ll show it to you—in fact, I’m going in
myself to get some brass-headed carpet nails.”</p>

<p>The shop stood sideways to the street, as if anxious
for concealment, and was the most astonishing place of
its kind that Wynyard had ever entered. A stall in an
Indian bazaar was tame and tidy in comparison. The
house was old and low, the shop of narrow dimensions;
it widened out as it ran back, and lost itself in a sort of
tumbledown greenhouse. The smell was extraordinary,
so varied, penetrating, and indescribable—and small
wonder, he said to himself, when he had inspected the
stock!</p>

<p>An oldish woman with a long nose (the Ottinge nose)
stood stiffly behind the counter; at her left the window
was full of stale confectionery, biscuit tins, sticky sweets
in glass bottles, oranges and apples in candle boxes; heaps
of Rickett’s blue, and some fly-blown advertisements.</p>

<p>Behind Mrs. Topham were two shelves dedicated to
“the library,” which consisted of remarkably dirty and
battered sixpenny novels; these she hired to the village
at the generous price of a penny a volume for one week.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
To the left of the entrance were more shelves, piled
with cheap toys, haberdashery, and china; and here
ended the front of the shop. Concealed by a low screen
were tins of oil, a barrel of ginger ale on tap, and a large
frying-pan full of dripping. The remainder of the
premises was abandoned to the greengrocery business
on a large scale—onions, potatoes, and cabbages in
generous profusion.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mrs. Topham,” said Miss Morven.
“What a wet day! How is your cough?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m amongst the middlings, miss. What can I
do for you?”</p>

<p>“I want some brass-headed carpet nails, and my
aunts have sent a list;” and she motioned to Wynyard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Topham seized upon it with her long, yellow
fingers (they resembled talons)—the Manor were good
customers.</p>

<p>“You can send over the things, Mrs. Topham; but I
want the nails now.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, miss, I’ve got ’em, but I can’t just rightly
think where they be.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, she turned out a drawer and rummaged
through it violently, and then another; the contents of
these gave one an idea of what is seriously understood
by the word “chaos”: wool, toffee, night-lights, dog
biscuits, and pills were among the ingredients.</p>

<p>“Try the blue box,” suggested Aurea, who was
evidently acquainted with the resources of the establishment.</p>

<p>The blue box yielded nothing but a quantity of faded
pink ribbon, a few postcards of the church and Drum, a
dozen tennis balls, some small curling-pins, and several
quires of black-edged paper.</p>

<p>“Why, if that isn’t the very thing I was looking for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
last week!” exclaimed Mrs. Topham, as she pounced on
the paper. “And now Miss Jakes she’s bin and got it
over at Brodfield; ’tis a cruel chance to be near a big
town—and so there’s for you!”</p>

<p>As the search for nails promised to be protracted,
Miss Morven turned to Wynyard and said—</p>

<p>“You need not wait; please take the lampshade on,
and say that I’m coming.”</p>

<p>But before returning to the Manor he had yet another
errand to fulfil—a note for Mrs. Ramsay at Ivy House.
Here he rang repeatedly, he even gave heavy single
knocks with the bulbous brass knocker, but received no
reply beyond the distant barking of indignant dogs. At
last he went round and discovered a large paved yard,
but no human being. Then he ventured to approach
one of the sitting-room windows and peered in—a comfortable
dining-room with a cheerful fire, but empty.
No, just underneath the window on a sofa lay an elderly
man fast asleep. He wore grey woollen socks on his
slipperless feet, an empty tumbler stood on a chair beside
him—and this at eleven o’clock in the morning. (True,
O. Wynyard, but it had contained no stronger drink than
hot water.)</p>

<p>He had the intention of rapping at the pane, but
changed his mind and retired to the door, and as he
waited he heard a voice above him calling out in a rich
brogue—</p>

<p>“Bad scran to ye, Fanny, if there isn’t a young
gentleman below wid a big band-box, and he is afther
pullin’ out the bell by the roots; ’tis a shame to lave
him standin’ in all the pours of rain! An’ such a lovely
big man!”</p>

<p>At this moment the hall door was opened by a tall
dark woman in a mackintosh and motor cap, with two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
frantic fox-terriers on the lead, and a self-possessed
French bulldog in dignified attendance.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ve been waiting,” she said, in a soft
brogue. “I was away at the kennels, the servants
were upstairs, and the Captain is asleep.” Then, opening
the note (as well as the fox-terriers would permit),
she glanced over it, and the messenger glanced at her—a
woman of thirty-five, with a thin, well-bred face,
black hair, and very long lashes. When she lifted them,
he saw that her eyes were of a blue-black shade, both
sad and searching—the whole expression of her face
seemed to be concentrated in their pupils.</p>

<p>“Please tell Miss Parrett I’ll come to tea. I’ve no
time to write. I have to take the dogs out.” The fox-terriers
were straining hard at their leash. “They must
have exercise; and when these come back, there are
three more.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, Wynyard could hear the injured yelping
of their disappointed companions.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t open the little dogs’ room,” she called
to an elderly woman in the background, who gave the
amazing answer—</p>

<p>“And what would ail me?”</p>

<p>“And mind that the Captain has his broth at twelve.”
Then she stepped out into the beating rain, and Wynyard
was surprised to find that Mrs. Ramsay was about to
accompany him.</p>

<p>“I’m going your way,” she explained; “it’s the
safest. These two are new dogs, and I’m rather afraid
to go near the Rectory; their Aberdeen is such a quarrelsome
beast—always trailing his coat.”</p>

<p>“Mackenzie?”</p>

<p>“Ah, and so you know him?” she said, with a
smile; “you weren’t long in making his acquaintance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Wynyard exhibited his left hand, and a severe bite.</p>

<p>“I suppose he was trying to kill Joss; that’s his
profession—a killer of other dogs.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have a good many of them,” as an
afterthought, “ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Yes; they are not all my own. I take in boarders—only
six at a time, and they must be small, no invalids
accepted. I look after them for people who go abroad,
or from home for a few weeks. I am fond of dogs, so
I combine business and pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; but they must be a trouble and a
responsibility—other people’s pets.”</p>

<p>“I have to take my chance! Some are so nice, it
just breaks my heart to part with them. Indeed, there’s
Tippy here, the bulldog, I’m pretending he is sick—<i>isn’t</i>
it a shame of me? Some are surly, others so sporting,
that half my time is spent in scouring the country,
and looking into rabbit holes. Others are quarrelsome,
or chase, snap, and kill fowl and get me into great
trouble. I never keep <i>them</i> on an hour after their time
is up. You are the Miss Parretts’ chauffeur, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Is this your first situation?” eyeing him keenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Why did she ask such a question? Did she, to use
the good old expression, “smell a rat”?</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will find Ottinge terribly dull. I
wonder how you discovered a place so far from everywhere—just
the back of beyond?” and she looked
at him interrogatively—her dark blue eyes were extraordinarily
piercing.</p>

<p>To this impertinent remark no reply was necessary,
as it brought them precisely to the Manor gate. The
lady nodded, and walked on quickly—a slim, active,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
resolute figure, with the straining fox-terriers dragging
at her hands, the little bulldog trotting sedately at her
heels. The group passed steadily out towards the open
country, with the light rain drifting down upon them.
What queer people one came across in Ottinge! Miss
Parrett, the ill-tempered old bully, the Hon. Mrs.
Ramsay, with her soft voice and expressive eyes, eking
out a living by making herself a slave to strangers’
dogs.</p>

<p>“Oh, so she sent a verbal message, did she?”
snorted Miss Parrett. “Well, when <i>I</i> was a girl,”—turning
to her sister—“and people asked me out, I always
wrote them <i>a proper note</i>; but manners are not what
they were in my day. Oh, if my dear, courteous father
could only know of some of the things that are done,
he would turn in his grave!”</p>

<p>Miss Parrett was fond of quoting the old Colonel,
and insisting upon his devotion to herself; whilst, if the
truth were known, they had been bitterly antagonistic
to one another during his lifetime, and the Manor was
the frequent scene of acrimonious quarrelling, unfilial
gibes, and furious rejoinders.</p>

<p>It was fully a quarter of an hour later when Miss
Morven arrived with the brass-headed carpet nails.</p>

<p>“I <i>knew</i> she had them!” she declared triumphantly;
“for she got a lot for us last winter, so I ransacked the
shop, and, after a long search, where do you think I
found them, Susan?”</p>

<p>“In her pocket, to be sure!”</p>

<p>“No, not quite—probably I shall next time. In one
of the brown teapots she has on sale! She <i>was</i> surprised—I
wasn’t! She is getting quite dotty, and won’t have
help; and there is Dilly, her pretty, flighty granddaughter,
with nothing to do but flirt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>All that day Wynyard worked zealously, assisting
the carpenter (who had come after all) and in unpacking
and dusting books that had not seen daylight for thirty
years. On this occasion, in spite of Miss Parrett’s
condescending invitation, he dined at Holiday Cottage.</p>

<p>That very same evening Mrs. Ramsay came to tea
at the Manor, and was fervent in her admiration of the
drawing-room, which praise Miss Parrett absorbed with
toothless complacency, saying in her quavering bleat—</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you like it. Of course it was <i>my</i> taste,
and my ideas, and they are my things; but Aurea and
Susan helped me—yes, and the chauffeur made himself
useful.”</p>

<p>Wynyard, who was working close by, felt inclined
to laugh out loud. It seemed to him that he was everything
but a chauffeur: window-cleaner, carpet-layer,
messenger, and assistant carpenter—a good thing he
was naturally pretty handy. And although all these
extra burdens had been laid upon him, the first impulse
to throw up the situation had died away; he did not
mind what jobs the old lady set him to do, but would
take them as all in the day’s work, for he had no intention
of leaving Ottinge at present—he must have some consideration
for Leila!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After tea, when Miss Parrett was engaged in
scolding her domestics and writing violent postcards
to her tradesmen, Mrs. Ramsay drew Aurea into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Well, me dear,” and her dark eyes danced, “I did
not say a word before your aunts, but I’ve <i>seen</i> the
remarkable chauffeur! I assure you, when I opened the
door and found him standing there with a large box,
you might have knocked me down with the traditional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
feather! I was taking the new dogs out for a run, and so
we walked together to this gate.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of him?” asked Aurea, carelessly,
as she rearranged some daffodils in a blue bowl.</p>

<p>“What do I think? I think—although he scarcely
opened his lips—that there is some mystery attached to
him, and that he is a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say so?” inquired the girl, anxious to
hear her own opinion endorsed. “He is not a bit smarter
than the Woolcocks’ men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not exactly smartness, me dear, it’s the
‘born so’ air which nothing can disguise. His matter-of-course
lifting his cap, walking on the outside, opening
the gate, and, above all, his <i>boots</i>.”</p>

<p>“Boots!”</p>

<p>“Yes, his expensive aristocratic shooting boots; I
vow they come from Lobbs. Jimmy got his there—before
he lost his money.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the chauffeur bought them second-hand?”
suggested Aurea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ramsay ignored the remark with a waving
hand.</p>

<p>“I cannot think what has induced a man of his class
to come and bury himself here in this God-forsaken spot.”</p>

<p>“Ottinge-in-the-Marsh is obliged to you!”</p>

<p>“Now, you know what I mean, Aurea. You are a
clever girl. I put the question to him, and got no satisfactory
answer. Is it forgery, murder, piracy on the high
seas, somebody’s wife—or what?” She rested her chin
on her hand, and nodded sagaciously at her companion.
“I understand that he has been working indoors a good
deal, and helping you and Miss Susan.” She paused
significantly. “You must have seen something of him.
Tell me, darling, how did you find him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Most useful, wonderfully clever with his hands,
strong, obliging, and absolutely speechless.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Does he have his meals here?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, what a cruel blow for the maid-servants!
Did he come from a garage?”</p>

<p>“No; a friend of Aunt Bella’s found him.”</p>

<p>“A woman friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she gave him an excellent character.”</p>

<p>“And what of hers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Kathleen, she is Lady Kesters, a
tremendously smart Society lady, awfully clever, too, and
absolutely <i>sans reproche</i>!”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” drawled Mrs. Ramsay. “Well, somehow
or other, I’ve an uneasy feeling about her protégé.
There is more than meets the eye with respect to that
young man’s character, believe me. My woman’s
instinct says so. I’m sorry he has come down and taken
up your aunt’s situation, for I seem to feel in me bones
that he will bring trouble to some one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kathleen! You and your Irish superstitions!”
and Aurea threw up her hands, clasping them among her
masses of hair, and stared into her friend’s face and
laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, if he does nothing worse, he will have
half the girls in love with him, and breaking their hearts.
It’s too bad of him, so good-looking, and so smart, coming
and throwing the ‘comether’ over this sleepy little
village. Believe me, darlin’, he has been turned out
of his own place; and it would never surprise <i>me</i>
if he was just a nice-looking young wolf in sheep’s
clothing!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what it is to have the nice, lurid, Celtic imagination!”
exclaimed Aurea. “I don’t think the poor man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
would harm a fly. Joss has taken to him as a brother—and——”</p>

<p>“Miss Morven as—a sister?”</p>

<p>“Now, what are you two conspiring about?” inquired
Miss Susan, entering, brisk, smiling, and inquisitive.</p>

<p>“I’m only discussing your chauffeur, me darlin’ Miss
Susan. I notice that several of the village girls drop in
on Mrs. Hogben—you see I live opposite—and they
expose their natural admiration without scruple or
reserve.”</p>

<p>“Owen is a useful young man, if he is a bit ornamental—isn’t
he, Aurea? I’m going to get him to help me in
the greenhouse, for I don’t believe, at this rate, that we
shall <i>ever</i> use the car.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE DRUM AND ITS PATRONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hogben</span> had lost no time in giving her lodger explicit
instructions as to what was expected of him in
Ottinge! Her lecture assumed a negative form. He
was not to take out any one’s girl, or there’d be trouble;
he was not to talk too much politics, or there’d be more
trouble; he was not to drink and get fuddled and fighting,
or there was the Bench and a fine; as to amusement,
there was cricket, Mrs. Topham’s Library, and
the Drum Inn, for his evenings.</p>

<p>The good woman said to herself, “The motor is always
washed and put away by six o’clock, and if he comes
here, he must either sit in his room or in the kitchen, and
<i>she</i> wasn’t a-goin’ to have that blocked up with young
girls, and never a chair for herself and her own friends.”</p>

<p>Wynyard readily took the hint; at Ottinge one
must do as Ottinge did, and he cheerfully accompanied
Tom over to the Drum a few evenings after his arrival.</p>

<p>“What sort of liquor do they keep, Tom?” he
asked, as they crossed the street.</p>

<p>“Well, some be better nor some, but there’s no
bad beer; the old stuff here is rare and strong, but it
comes pretty dear.”</p>

<p>The low, wainscoted taproom, with its sanded
floor, was full of day-labourers, herds, ploughmen,
cow-men, and carters taking their bit of pleasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
talking loudly and disjointedly, drinking beer in
mugs, or playing the ever-popular game of “ring.”
Here, for the first time in his life, Wynyard was brought
into personal contact, as man to man, with the
agricultural world as it is. In the more exclusive bar
were to be found farmers, owners of certain comfortable
red houses scattered up and down the street,
the organist, the schoolmaster, the grocer—in short, the
moneyed patrons of the hostelry. Several were talking
over village affairs, discussing politics, racing, artificial
manures, or cattle. Some were playing draughts, some
were reading the daily papers, others were doing
nothing. Of these, one was a bent, gentlemanly individual
in a grey tweed suit, with a grey moustache, a
grey, sunken, vacant face, who sat aloof smoking a brier
pipe—his eyes staring into vacancy. Another was a
white-haired, shrunken old man, who wore green
carpet slippers, and occupied a cushioned arm-chair,
and the best seat near the fire. This was Joe Thunder,
the oldest inhabitant, ninety-three years of age his last
birthday. Once upon a time he had seen the world—and
other worlds; now he was comfortably moored
in a fine, substantial cottage with a garden back and
front, kept bees, was an authority on roses, and filled
the post of the patriarch of Ottinge.</p>

<p>All newcomers were formally presented to Daddy
Thunder, and as Tom pushed Wynyard in his direction
he said—</p>

<p>“This be the Parrett ladies’ new man, daddy.”
To Owen, “Daddy, here, he knows the place well, and
can tell ye all about it, better nor any, though he wasn’t
Ottinge born.”</p>

<p>Daddy slowly removed his long clay pipe, and inspected
the stranger with a pair of shrewd little grey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
eyes. He had rosy cheeks, a benevolent, even sweet
expression, and looked fifteen years younger than his age.</p>

<p>“Ye come fra’ London?” he began agreeably.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, three days ago. It’s a good long journey.”</p>

<p>“Ay, mister,” nodding his white head expressively.
“Ye don’t belong to <i>us</i>. Yer speech—like the Bible
chap—bewrayeth ye—y’re no working man!”</p>

<p>“I am, indeed,” rejoined Wynyard quickly, “and
working for my bread the same as the rest of the company;
it’s all I have to look to—my two hands.”</p>

<p>“Nay, is that so?” and he glanced at him incredulously.
“Well, I’ve bin here a matter o’ twenty year,
and I never see one o’ your make a-comin’ in and settin’
in the Drum. There’s ’im,” and he indicated the bent
figure in the corner, whose pipe was in his hand, his eyes
riveted on the stranger with a look of startled inquiry.</p>

<p>“That’s the Captain, but ’e’s no account. ’E comes
in and ’e sits and maybe listens; ’e never speaks. They
do say ’e ’ad a soort o’ stroke in India, and ’is brain ’as
melted like, but ’e is ’armless enough—anyhow, ’is lady
won’t put ’im away.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve lived here a long time?” said
Wynyard, drawing forward a chair, and placing it so as
to sit with his back to the said Captain, whose stare was
disagreeably steady.</p>

<p>“Twenty year, more or less. I am a south country
man, and my daughter she married and settled ’ere,
and ’er ’usband died; an’ as there was only the two on us,
I come along to keep ’er company, and to die ’ere, since
I was gettin’ pretty old, being over seventy; but, Lor’
bless ye! that’s twenty-two year ago, and ’ere I be
still gettin’ about, and doin’ a bit o’ gardenin’. The air is
grand—nothing ails me but gout,” holding out a crippled
hand. “This isn’t the place to die in—it’s the place to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
live in. It keeps ye alive. Why, I’m ninety-three.
Oh, it’s what ye may call a terrible lively place.”</p>

<p>This was not his listener’s opinion, who would have
instituted instead the word “deadly.”</p>

<p>“You must have seen a great deal in ninety-three
years,” said Wynyard, lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>“Lor’ bless ye, yes; and I’ve a wunnerful memory.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the days of Napoleon?”</p>

<p>“What—old Bony! Nay,” a little offended, “I’m
not as old as <i>that</i>; but I do mind a talk o’ ’is funeral
in France.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I’m an awful duffer at dates.
You remember Wellington?”</p>

<p>“Oh ay, ’e was only the other day, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“And what else do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Well, as a lad, I remember I was terrible afeerd o’
the press gang.”</p>

<p>“The press gang?”</p>

<p>“Ay; that come pokin’ round after able-bodied men
for the Navy, and kidnappin’ ’em away to sea, and
keepin’ them there, whether or no, for years, and their
families at home starvin’.”</p>

<p>“I say, what times!”</p>

<p>“Ay, so they was. I’ve seen two men ’angin’ in
chains on Camley Moor when I was about ten—it were
for sheep-stealin’, and put the fear o’ death on me. Surely
I can ’ear them chains a-clankin’ now!”</p>

<p>Wynyard felt as if he had been suddenly precipitated
into another world. Here he was, sitting talking to a
live man, who discoursed familiarly of hanging in chains,
and the press gang!</p>

<p>“Would you take something, sir?” he asked. “I’d
like to drink your health.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, I don’t mind ’avin’ a glass wi’ ye.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Ginders! Ginders!” raising his voice, “give us a taste
of yer old beer, the <i>best</i>—two half-pints;” and, as they
were brought, he looked at Wynyard, and said, “To ye,
young sir, and good luck to ye in Ottinge; may ye live
as long as I do!”</p>

<p>“Thank you; have you any prescription for your
wonderful health?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I have so. Look ’ere, I’ve not tasted medicine
for fifty year. I don’t hold wi’ doctors. I only eat twice
a day—my breakfast at eight, and my dinner at two.
My daughter she do mike me a cup o’ tea at six, but I
don’t want it, and it’s only to oblige <i>her</i>. Work—work’s
the thing when yer young. I mind bein’ in the train
one day, and a great heavy man complainin’ o’ his pore
’ealth, and ’is inside, and another says, ‘I can tell ye o’ a
cure, master, and a sure one.’ ‘What’s that?’ ses ’e, all
alive. ‘Rise of a mornin’ at four o’clock, and mow an
acre before ye break yer fast, and go on mowing all day—that
will cure ye—ye’ll be a new man.’ ‘I’d be a dead
un,’ ses ’e. <i>My</i> advice is: no medicine, short commons,
lots of work, and there ye are, and ye’ll live to maybe
a hundred.”</p>

<p>“But what about cuts and wounds? How do you
doctor them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a plaster o’ earth, or a couple o’ lily leaves.
One is as good as t’other. Well, I’m a-goin’,” struggling
to his feet; “an old gaffer like me keeps early hours.”</p>

<p>As Wynyard handed him his stick, he slapped him
smartly on the back, and it was evident from this
accolade that the “shover” was now made free of the
Drum.</p>

<p>The newcomer looked about him, some were playing
dominoes, some cards, one or two were reading the day’s
papers, and all the time the Captain sat immovable in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
corner, and his eyes never moved from Wynyard. Such
cold, impassive staring made him feel uncomfortable,
and settling his reckoning he presently followed old
Thunder’s example and went home.</p>

<p>Captain Ramsay, whose fixed attention had made the
stranger so uneasy, had once been a popular officer in a
popular regiment, and when quartered in India had fallen
in love with and married the Hon. Kathleen Brian
(daughter of an impoverished viscount) who was on a visit
to relatives in Simla. The first year was rapturously
happy for both of them, and then one day, when out pig-sticking
near Cawnpore, Captain Ramsay had his topee
knocked off, and in the excitement of the chase galloped
on, with the result that he was knocked over by a sunstroke.
Sunstroke was followed by brain fever, and he
nearly died. Ultimately he was invalided home, and,
owing to ill-health, obliged to leave the Service. Nor was
this all. He seemed to become another man, his character
underwent a complete change; he was quarrelsome and
morose, fought with his own family, insulted his wife’s
people, and developed into an Ishmael. He invested his
money in the maddest ventures, and rapidly dispersed
his entire fortune (Kathleen was penniless), and now
nothing remained but his small pension. Year by year
he became more disagreeable, restless, and strange.
The couple wandered from place to place, from lodging to
lodging. Vainly his wife’s relatives implored her to leave
him; he was “impossible,” her health was suffering; she,
who had been so pretty, at twenty-seven looked prematurely
faded and haggard; but Kathleen was obstinate,
and would go her own way and stick to her bad bargain.
Her brothers did not know, and would never know, the
Jimmy she had married—so clever, amusing, good-looking,
the life of his company, a first-rate officer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and a matchless horseman; the man who got up the
regimental theatricals, ran the gymkhana, was editor
of the regimental paper, and so devoted to her always.
No, no, she would never abandon him, though every
year he grew worse, and more brusque, excitable, and
unsociable; and every year saw them sinking still
further in the social scale.</p>

<p>At last an aged uncle died, and left Captain Ramsay
Ivy House, Ottinge, with its old-fashioned furniture,
linen, books, and plate. This windfall, with his pension,
would keep them going, and at best it afforded a retreat
and a hiding-place. The neighbourhood with flattering
alacrity had called on Captain and the Hon. Mrs. Ramsay,
and she was declared to be charming, so agreeable and still
handsome. She duly returned their visits in a hired fly,
left her husband’s cards, Captain J. V. Ramsay, and made
his excuses.</p>

<p>It soon was evident that the Ramsays were desperately
poor, and did not intend to keep a trap or entertain; that
he was queer, and only to be met about the fields and
lanes, or in the Drum; but by degrees the neighbours
came to know Mrs. Ramsay better, and to like her
extremely. She had travelled, was a brilliant conversationalist,
and a sound bridge player; she was also
an Honourable—one of the many daughters of Lord
Ballingarry of Moyallan Castle—so the neighbours bought
her little ‘Poms,’ recommended the hotel to their friends,
lent her carriages or motors, sent her game and books,
and did their best for her. But Captain Ramsay was
beyond any one’s assistance; he refused to see people,
or to know Ottinge. He went abroad generally with the
bats and the owls, along lonely roads and footpaths; his
daily paper and the Drum were his sole resources, and
only that, at long intervals, a shrivelled figure was caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sight of shuffling up the High Street, the neighbourhood
would have forgotten that Captain Ramsay existed.</p>

<p>Lady Kesters sent papers and wrote weekly letters to
J. Owen, Holiday Cottage, Ottinge. But her brother’s
replies were short, vague, and unsatisfactory, and in
answer to a whole sheet of reproaches, he dedicated a wet
Sunday afternoon to his sister. He began:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Leila</span>,—I had your letter yesterday, and it’s a
true bill that I am a miserable correspondent, and that
my notes are as short and sweet as a donkey’s gallop.
I only got twenty marks in composition when I passed.
Now, however, I’m going to put my back into this
letter, and send you a long scrawl, and, as you command
me, all details—no matter how insignificant. I am
writing in my room, because the kitchen is full of young
women—Mrs. Hogben’s at-home day, I suppose! The
parlour windows are never opened, the atmosphere is
poisonous, and thick with the reek of old furniture. So
here I am! I’ve faked up a table by putting blocks
under the yellow box, for the washstand is impossible.
This room is old and low; if I stand upright in some places,
my head is likely to go through the ceiling, and in others
my legs to go through the floor; but I know the lie of the
land now. The window looks into a big orchard, and
beyond that are miles of flat country; but you’ve seen
Ottinge, so I spare you local colour. I am all right here.
Mrs. Hogben is a rare good sort, and does me well, washing
included, for twenty-three shillings a week, and I make
out my own bills—as she neither reads nor writes, but
takes it out in talking. When I had a cold, she made
me a decoction called ‘Tansie Tea’ and insisted on my
swallowing it—the fear of another dose cured me. Her
son Tom is a decent chap, and we are pals; he works at
the Manor as second gardener of two. As to the ladies
there, I am disappointed in Miss Parrett; you told me
they were <i>both</i> ‘old dears.’ Susan really is an old dear,
but, in my opinion, Miss P. is an old <i>D.</i> Possibly you
only knew her as a tea-drinking, charming hostess, full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
compliments and sweetness; the real Miss Bella is a bully,
vain of her money, and shamelessly mean.</p>

<p>“The Manor is a nice, sunny house, flat on the ground,
with great oak beams and rum windows, and a splendid
garden enclosed in yew hedges run to seed; they are
trying to get it in order, clipping the yews and digging
out the moss, but two men and a boy are not enough, and
Miss P. is too stingy to employ more. As I’ve little to
do, I sometimes lend a hand. The motor is a faked-up
old rattle-trap, all paint and smart cushions; but its inside
is worn out. Miss Parrett is under the impression that
petrol is not a necessity, and I have such desperate work
to get it, and she always cross-examines me so sharply,
and gives the money as such a personal favour, that one
would suppose I wanted the beastly thing for my own
consumption. It is a riddle to me <i>why</i> she ever bought
the car. She is afraid to go out in it, and won’t let her
sister use it alone. I’ve been here four weeks; it’s been
out six times, always at a crawl, and within a four-mile
radius. Miss Parrett likes to pay visits to show off her
‘beautiful’ car; but I feel like a Bath-chair man!</p>

<p>“One day we went over to Westmere, the Davenants’
old place, where you used to stay. The Woolcocks, who
have it now, are enormously rich, go-ahead people, and
the married daughter pounced on me as Owen the
steward on board ship! No one here has any idea who I
am, and I keep a shut mouth; and when I do talk, I try
to copy Tom Hogben. There are few gentry about,—that
is, in Ottinge; the parson, Mr. Morven, the Parretts’
brother-in-law, comes in sometimes and gives advice
about the garden. He is a cheery sort, elderly, a widower,
and a splendid preacher—thrown away on this dead-and-alive
spot. His sermons are sensible and modern, and
you’ve something to carry away and think of, instead of
wanting to shy hymn-books, or go to sleep. The church
is a tremendous age, and restored—the Ottinge folk are
very proud of it. In one chancel, the north chancel, lie
our kin the Davenants; there is a fine window, erected
by a certain Edward Davenant to the memory of his wife,
the lady in a pink scarf—quite a smart get-up of, say, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
hundred years ago, is represented as one of the angels, and
he himself is among the disciples. Both were copied
from family portraits. What do you think of the idea?</p>

<p>“Mr. Morven has let me in for singing in the choir; you
should see me in a surplice—it barely comes to my knees,
and makes me feel so shy! Thanks to the choir, I’ve got
to know the organist, and the schoolmaster—a very decent
chap; I go and smoke a pipe there of an evening, and
also a young farmer who has promised me some fishing
when I can get off—that’s not often. There is no village
club, as you may remember, and the men of the place
assemble at the Drum Inn. I drop in there sometimes,
though, just as often, I take a tramp over the country,
accompanied by the Manor dog, who has adopted me, and
often does ‘a night out.’ Mrs. Hogben leaves the door
on the latch. She also told me I should go to the Drum
along with Tom, as she thought I was a bit dull; so to the
Drum I go, to show I’m not above my mates, and I have
a glass of beer and a pipe, and hear all the village news, and
the village elders discussing parish rates, socialism, free
trade, the price of stock, and how Jakes’ Bob is going into
the grocery, and Harry Tews’ spring cabbage has failed!</p>

<p>“There is one queer figure there: a broken-down,
decrepit officer, Captain Ramsay, whose wife lives in the
village and keeps a dogs’ hotel. He looks as if he drank,
and is always muddled, or else he is mad. He speaks to
no one, but he never takes his eye off <i>me</i>. I tell you, Sis,
I don’t half like it—though I swear he has never seen me
before.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope Martin is better. I’m sorry he has been
feeling a bit cheap; it’s a pity I can’t send him some of
this air—splendid; there’s an old chap of ninety-three in
the place—still going strong.</p>

<p>“Your papers are a godsend. I pass them on to the
schoolmaster, and he lends me books; but although I
seem to do little, I never have much time for reading.
I’m getting on all right, and intend to stick to the old
birds, the green car, and Ottinge; though, as it said
in the Psalms this morning, it does seem to be a ‘land
where all things are forgotten.’ At any rate our ways are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
primitive and virtuous—we have one policeman, he sings
bass in the choir,—and we hold little conversation with
the outer world. Indeed, news—other than local—is
despised. The sweep is our postman, and the village
softy limps round with the papers when he thinks of it.
I’m about to be enrolled in the Ottinge Cricket Club, and
I’m looking forward to some sport. They little guess
that I played in the Eton eleven! Here endeth this
epistle, which must count as a dozen and thirteen.—Your
affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="right">“O. St. J. W.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Kesters read this letter quickly, then she went
over it very deliberately; finally she handed it to her
husband.</p>

<p>“He seems perfectly happy and satisfied, though he
detests Miss Parrett and says the car is an old rattle-trap.
He has no pals, very little to do, and has taken to
gardening and singing in the choir.” She paused expressively.
“Somehow I don’t see Owen in <i>that</i> picture,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say I do,” replied her husband.</p>

<p>“Just the last sort of life to suit him, I should have
thought. Martin, do you suppose that’s a faked-up
letter, and he wrote it to relieve my mind?”</p>

<p>“No; the chap hasn’t it in him to fake anything. I’d
rather like to hear his attempts at the local dialect!”</p>

<p>“Then tell me what you really think; I see you have
something in your head.”</p>

<p>“My dear, I’m astonished you don’t see it for yourself!
You are ten times as clear-sighted as I am,” and
he hesitated; “why, of course, there’s a young woman in
the case.”</p>

<p>“He never mentions her!” objected his wife.</p>

<p>“A deadly symptom.”</p>

<p>“Some village girl—no. And he is bound not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
think of any love-affair or entanglement for two whole
years.”</p>

<p>“How long has he been at Ottinge—four weeks, eh?”
She nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I believe that, in spite of your uncle and you,
Owen is in love with some one already.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>LIEUTENANT WYNYARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an undeniable fact that the chauffeur spent much
more time in the Manor grounds than driving the car.
The car was rarely used, and anything was better than
loafing about the yard or the village with his hands in
his pockets—one of the unemployed. Wynyard liked
the fresh smell of the earth, and growing things, the
songs of birds—especially of the blackbird, with his
leisurely fluting note.</p>

<p>The garden, which lay to the left of the house, overlooked
meadows, and was evidently as ancient as the
Manor itself. It was also one after the heart of Bacon,
“Spacious and fair, encompassed with a stately hedge.”
The farmer, who had neglected the roof and upper floors
of the dwelling, had suffered these same yew hedges to
grow as they pleased; and they now required a great
deal of labour in trimming them to moderate proportions.
The soil was rich—anything and everything
seemed to flourish in the garden, which was intersected
by broad gravelled walks that crossed one another
at regular intervals; these were lined by a variety of
old-fashioned plants—myrtle, lavender, and sweetbrier,
grown to gigantic dimensions; here were also Madonna
Lilies, London Pride, Hollyhocks, Sweet-William, and
bushes of out-of-date roses, such as the “York and
Lancaster,” and other Georgian survivals. Precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
in the middle of the garden, where four walks met,
was a hoary sundial, which bore the inscription, “<span class="smcap">Time
Tries All</span>.” A path, leading direct from the sundial
to an ancient bowling-green, was enclosed with rustic
arches, and in the summer time the Manor pergola
was a veritable tunnel of roses, and one of the sights of
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>And here it was that the unemployed chauffeur
spent most of his time, clipping intractable hedges, planting,
pruning, and digging. Such occupation removed
him effectually from the orbit of his enemy—Miss Parrett—who
merely pottered about the beds immediately surrounding
the house. This was Miss Susan’s realm—she
was the family gardener; his volunteered labour also
afforded Wynyard the now rare and priceless privilege
of seeing Miss Morven when she ran in to talk to her
aunt and help in the greenhouse—since, thanks to her
active exertions, the Manor had been set in order, and her
visits were no longer of daily occurrence. Now and then
he caught sight of her, walking with Mrs. Ramsay and
her “guests,” motoring with Mrs. Waring, or riding
with her father. Once or twice they had passed him in
the lanes at a late hour, riding fast, pursued by the
panting Mackenzie. His best opportunity of meeting
the young lady was at choir practice, and here he admired
Miss Morven, not only for her sweet, clear voice, but her
marvellous tact and admirable skill, the way she pacified
Pither, the cranky old organist (a fine musician), and
smoothed down rivals who claimed to sing solos, applauded
the timid, and gently repressed the overbold.
It was delightful to watch her consulting and advising
and encouraging; but how could any one escape from
the effect of that girl’s beauty and contagious spirits? or
withstand the influence of the subtle power called charm?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>On Sundays she sat in the Rector’s pew, facing the
square enclosure of the Woolcocks, over which hung
stately hatchments and memorials of the Davenant family;
and from his corner in the choir Wynyard noted, with
secret uneasiness and wrath, how the heir of Westmere—a
squarely built, heavy young squire—kept his worshipping
eyes fastened upon Aurea’s clear-cut profile.
After all, what was it to him? he asked himself furiously.
Young Woolcock was heir to twenty thousand a year,
and what was <i>he</i> at present? but her aunts’ servant!</p>

<p>There had been a good deal of excited speculation
in the village respecting Wynyard—as to who he really
was, and where he came from. But although some
swore he had been a soldier, and others vowed he had
been a sailor, no one was any the wiser than the first
day that he had arrived at Mrs. Hogben’s, followed by
his yellow tin box. “Ay, he could hold his tongue,
that was sure; and was always ready enough to lend an
ear to other people’s affairs—but tight as an oyster with
regard to his own.”</p>

<p>Miss Susan, who felt towards him a kindness that was
almost maternal, tormented by curiosity, had done her
utmost to pump him. One day, in the greenhouse, she
had seemed to see her opportunity. He had read off a
French name on a label, and his accent and glibness were
perfection.</p>

<p>“Ah! I see you have had a good education, Owen,”
she remarked, beaming at him over her glasses.</p>

<p>“Oh, middling, miss.”</p>

<p>“You keep a boy to clean the motor, I hear!”</p>

<p>“Only once or twice, miss, when my hand was sore.
His people are poor, and a shilling doesn’t come amiss.”</p>

<p>“I feel certain,” clearing her throat, “that you are
not accustomed to this sort of life, Owen.” As she spoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
she kept her clear blue eyes on his face, and looked at
him with the direct simplicity of a child. “I am interested
in you, Owen. Do tell me about yourself, you
know I wish you well.”</p>

<p>“Miss Susan,” and he straightened his shoulders
and set down the pot he was holding, “you received
my reference from Lady Kesters—and I believe it was
all right?”</p>

<p>Miss Susan became very red indeed, and the garden
scissors slipped from her thumb. There was something
unusual in the young man’s tone and glance.</p>

<p>“If you or Miss Parrett find that I am not giving
satisfaction——”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, no!” she broke in breathlessly, “I—I’m
afraid I’m rather inquisitive—but I take a real
interest in you, and you have been <i>such</i> a help to me—and
I feel so friendly towards you—but, I won’t ask
you any more questions.”</p>

<p>This little scene was subsequently related to Aurea,
as she and her aunt drank tea together at the Rectory,
and Miss Susan imparted to the girl—between bites of
buttered toast—her own eager speculations. Mystery
has a wonderful charm! A handsome young man,
who was both reserved and obliging, who, it was known,
was respected in the Drum, and kept to himself, and
whom she believes to be one of her own class—offers a
dangerous attraction for a girl of twenty! Aurea
debated the puzzle in the abysmal depth of her own
heart, and when a girl once allows her thoughts to dwell
persistently upon a man—no matter what his station—her
interest in him is bound to develop far beyond
the bounds of everyday acquaintance!</p>

<p>Aurea was startled to discover that her mind was
dwelling on the chauffeur more than was desirable; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
occupied too large a share of her thoughts, though she
did her utmost to expel him, and fill them with other
matters—such, for instance, as the parish almshouses, the
clothing club, and the choir—but a taciturn, mysterious
young man, figuratively, thrust himself head and shoulders
above these commonplace matters. Owen had a good
voice, and had been impressed into the choir—a rollicking
hunting song, sung at the Drum, had betrayed him. It
was customary there, on certain nights, to sit round in a
circle and call upon the members for entertainment, and
Owen’s “John Peel” had established his reputation.</p>

<p>Aurea was secretly annoyed by the way that girls on
practice nights set their caps at the newcomer—boldly
attracting his attention, appealing to his opinion, nudging
one another significantly, and giggling and simpering
when they spoke to him. And he? He met them half-way,
shared hymn-books, found places, and talked, and
seemed to be entirely happy and at ease in their company.
Why not? He was ostensibly of their own class. He
had not flinched from accepting a peppermint from Lily
Jakes,—on the contrary, had received it with effusion,—and
the overblown rosebud, tossed at him by Alexandra
Watkins, had subsequently decorated his buttonhole.</p>

<p>Aurea contemplated these signs of good fellowship
with stifled irritation. Was she envious, because the
chauffeur, her aunts’ servant, usually so monosyllabic
and self-contained, could laugh and talk with these
village girls? At this appalling arraignment her face
flamed, she shrank in horror from her own thoughts.
No, no, no, a hundred thousand times no!</p>

<p>Still, it must be confessed that, strive as she would,
she could not help wondering and speculating about
Owen, the chauffeur—whether she saw him vigorously
washing the car, or trundling a wheelbarrow in the garden;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
zealously as he worked, it seemed to her observant eye that
he looked as if he had not been accustomed to such employment.
Who was he? The answer to this question
came to her unexpectedly, and in a most unlikely place.</p>

<p>Aurea and her Aunt Susan went to Brodfield one afternoon,
in order to execute various commissions for the
Manor; the car was grudgingly lent for the occasion.
There would have been no expedition, only that Miss
Parrett was out of a certain shade of pink wool, the new
cook was out of tapioca, and Miss Susan was a little out of
sorts, and declared that “a drive in the air would cure her.”
The car waited at the post office, whilst the ladies
accomplished their different errands in different shops.
Aurea was the first to finish, and was sauntering slowly
up the street, when she noticed that rare sight—a soldier
in uniform—a smart Hussar on furlough, with a friend in
mufti, coming towards her. As they passed the car, they
glanced at it, and the soldier started, made a sort of halt,
stared stupidly, and brought his hand to the salute! Yes,
and the chauffeur gave him a little nod, and put his finger
to his cap! (apparently unconscious of Miss Morven’s
vicinity).</p>

<p>As the two men approached, talking loudly, she overheard
the Hussar say, as he strutted by—</p>

<p>“Well I’m damned, if that fellow on the car wasn’t
Lieutenant Wynyard! I was in his troop at Lucknow—a
rare smart officer, too. What’s his little game?”</p>

<p>“You’d better go back and arsk ’im,” suggested the
other, with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Not <i>me</i>,” and they were out of earshot.</p>

<p>Aurea felt dumbfounded, as she moved on and got into
her place. Susan, of course, was lingering as usual,
chattering and last-wording to acquaintances, and she
was not sorry to have a few moments to herself, to sit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
meditate on her surprising discovery. So Owen’s real
name was Wynyard—and he had been an officer in a
Hussar regiment. What <i>was</i> his game?</p>

<p>And her first impressions were justified; he was a
gentleman, in spite of Joey’s authoritative verdict and
Mrs. Ramsay’s gloomy forebodings. What dreadful
thing had he done to be compelled to live under
an assumed name, and bury himself, of all places, in
Ottinge?</p>

<p>Aurea was now more deeply interested and puzzled
than ever! She and Susan had no secrets from one
another—for Susan was so young in her mind and heart
that she seemed to be almost Aurea’s contemporary!</p>

<p>From the first they liked the chauffeur, and though
they had not said much, each was conscious of the other’s
opinion. Now that Aurea knew his name and former
status for a fact, strange to relate, she resolved to have
just this one little secret from Susan—and keep the
knowledge to herself!</p>

<p>On the way home she proved an unusually silent
and unsympathetic companion. Her conversation was
jerky and constrained; she was not in the least interested
in the scraps of local news that her aunt had collected
in street and shops, but appeared to be lost in
a maze of speculation and abstraction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>BY WATER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Parrett</span> felt slightly embarrassed and uncomfortable
when people remarked how seldom her motor was
seen! “Was it not satisfactory?” they inquired. The
old lady also recognised that her chauffeur was doing
the work of a really capital gardener, and was Susan’s
right hand; this annoyed her excessively. She disliked
the idea that her employé was slaving to please her sister;
and accordingly changed her tactics, gave instructions
for the car to go out twice a week with Miss Susan and
Miss Morven, or Miss Susan and Mrs. Ramsay.</p>

<p>Susan and her niece had promptly availed themselves
of this permission, and seized the opportunity of penetrating
into far-away villages and to distant country
seats; and the poor old motor, at their request, was
racketted along at its best speed, as they were bound to
be in Ottinge before dark, in order that the car might be
washed. If they, by any chance, were a little late, they
were received at the hall door by Miss Parrett, in cold
silence, watch in hand.</p>

<p>After the recent heavy rains, the low, marshy country
was flooded, and, returning one afternoon from a twenty-mile
expedition, at a sharp turn in the road where the
ground sloped steeply, the motor ran into a wide sheet of
water—a neighbouring river had burst its banks. There
was no going back, that was impossible. Miss Susan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
for once lost her nerve, and, putting her head out, asked
the chauffeur piteously—</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing for it, miss,” he answered
promptly. “I don’t think the water is deep, and I’ll
keep straight on—as near as I can guess—in the middle
of the road; you see, there are ditches at either side, and
I can’t turn; but you need not be nervous—as long as
the water doesn’t reach the magneto you are all right.”</p>

<p>But, as they crept forward cautiously, the water was
gradually rising; it rose and rose, till it stole in under the
door, and then the motor came to a full stop.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>, what’s going to happen?” demanded Miss
Susan excitedly.</p>

<p>“I see the road is not more than fifty yards ahead,
and the water is shallower. We have stuck in the worst
part.”</p>

<p>“But what is to become of us, my good man? Are
<i>we</i> to sit here all night—and the motor may blow up?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go to a farmhouse and borrow a couple of horses,
and I dare say after a bit I can start her again.”</p>

<p>“And are we to remain here, Owen, and be half-drowned?
You know my sister will be <i>crazy</i> if we are
not home by seven.”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I could do, Miss Susan,” he
replied, “that is if you have no objection; I can carry
you and Miss Morven through the water, and put you out
on the road high and dry. I think I might get a trap in
Swingford village; you could drive home, and I’ll bring
the car along to-morrow. It seems the only thing to be
done.”</p>

<p>After this suggestion there ensued a long and animated
consultation between aunt and niece; at last Miss Susan,
raising her voice, said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Very well, Owen, I see no alternative; you can take
me first—I am a light weight.”</p>

<p>Owen now descended from his place and waded to the
door, which he opened.</p>

<p>“All right, Miss Susan, you may depend on me. I
won’t drop you.”</p>

<p>“How am I to manage?” she asked shame-facedly.</p>

<p>“It’s quite easy! Just put your arms round my neck,
miss, and hold tight.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s coy reluctance—it was the first time
in her life she had ever put her arms round a man’s neck—Miss
Susan timidly embraced him.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” he commanded, and, lifting her bodily out
of the car as if she were a child, waded away, striding and
splashing up to his middle in water. When he had carefully
deposited her on dry land, the chauffeur returned
for the young lady, who, it must be confessed, awaited
him with a wildly beating heart; it seemed to her that in
his air there was actually a look of mastery and triumph.
If he had been an ordinary chauffeur, such as the Woolcocks’,
she would not have minded; but this man—this
Lieutenant Wynyard, who was of her own class—oh, how
she shrank from this enforced ordeal; she felt deeply
reluctant and ashamed.</p>

<p>However, she asked no questions, made no hysterical
protests, but rose as he appeared, put her arms on his
shoulders—though she would rather have waded up to
her neck—and was borne into the stream, upon which a
laggard moon had recently arisen. Little, little did
Aurea guess that, as she leant her head upon his leather
shoulder, how Owen, the chauffeur, had to fight with a
frantic, almost overmastering, desire to kiss her! And
what an outcry there would have been, not merely from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
the young lady herself, but the sole witness, her maiden
aunt!</p>

<p>Fortunately, with a superhuman effort, he pulled
himself together, steadied his racing pulses, and thrust
the dreadful idea behind him, as he struggled to the end
of his task, and presently placed Miss Morven high and dry
on the road beside her relative. Then, leaving the rescued
ladies to one another’s company, he set off to a village
two miles distant to hunt up some conveyance.</p>

<p>As Wynyard tramped along in his wet clothes, he had
it out with his ego. For all his youth and hot blood, he
had always a cool power of judgment—as far as his own
acts were concerned—and he was now prepared to discuss
the present situation with himself. Since he had held
Miss Aurea’s light form in his arms, felt her sweet breath
on his cheek, he knew there was no use in playing the
ostrich, and that he was hopelessly in love—had been in
love since the very first time he had set eyes upon her!
Looking back at the matter, calmly and dispassionately,
he realised that it was not on account of Leila’s disappointment
that he stayed on, and did not throw up his
situation—as Miss Parrett’s exasperating behaviour so
often tempted him to do. He remained at Ottinge solely
to be near Aurea; it was for Aurea that he kept his
temper, slaved in the garden, and sang in the choir;
yet he could not say a word to Aurea, or endeavour to
ingratiate himself like other more fortunate young men;
he had his bond to remember, and his hands were tied—yes,
and his tongue too. Was ever any fellow in such a
fix? And such was the contrariness of life, he had gone
about the world when he was free, and had never once
met a girl he thought of twice—and here he was always
thinking of Aurea, yet dared not disclose his feelings;
meanwhile, some luckier fellow would come along and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
make up to her and marry her! And at the thought
he stopped and ground his heel into the earth with
savage force.</p>

<p>There was Bertie Woolcock, rolling in money, heir to
that fine place; and he would have one year and ten
months’ start, whilst <i>he</i> was left at the post! Oh, it
was enough to drive him mad to think of! Well, Bertie
had never held her in his arms, at any rate,—he had;
how she had trembled, poor darling! Yes, he was that
to the good.</p>

<p>“Mean beast!” apostrophising himself; “when you
know that the girl could not help herself, and would have
given everything she possessed to get out of such a
dilemma!” What would Leila say? Should he tell her?
No; she would only laugh (he could hear her laugh) and
ask, “What are you going to marry on, even if Uncle
Dick lets you off?”</p>

<p>He had two pounds two shillings a week, and if he
made love to her niece, Miss Parrett would naturally
and properly send him about his business. Oh, it was
all an infernal muddle—there was no way out of it—nothing
to do but hide his feelings and bide his time;
the wild, haunting refrain of an old negro camp hymn
came into his head, “And hold the Lion down! and
hold the Lion down!” Well, he was holding the lion
down, and a thundering hard job he found it!</p>

<p>He had no reason to suspect that Aurea ever thought
of him—why should she? She was always polite,
gracious—no more. His only little scrap of comfort
lay in the fact that he believed Miss Susan liked him—liked
him really, in a nice, sentimental, proper, old-maid
fashion! She was romantic, so said her niece, who
bantered her on her passion for promoting love-affairs
and love-matches—he had heard her taunt her playfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
with the fact. Undoubtedly Miss Susan was his
good friend, and that was the sole morsel of comfort
he could offer himself!</p>

<p>Presently Wynyard reached a sleepy little village,
unearthed a carrier’s cart, horse, and man, and returned
to the place where the two ladies were awaiting him
with the liveliest impatience.</p>

<p>That evening, at nine o’clock, Miss Susan, who had
deposited her niece at the Rectory, arrived at home in
a carrier’s cart—the sole available mode of conveyance.
Her sister, who had been roaming about the hall and
passages, accompanied by Mrs. Ramsay, wringing her
hands and whimpering that “Susan had been killed,”
was considerably relieved. But, as soon as her fears
were subdued, she became frightfully excited respecting
the fate of her beautiful motor, which, by all accounts,
had been left standing in the middle of a river—five
miles from home.</p>

<p>“Oh, I assure you it will be all right, Bella; please
don’t worry yourself. Owen will manage.”</p>

<p>“Owen, indeed!” she echoed angrily; “it’s my
opinion that he manages <i>you</i>—you think a great deal too
much of that young man; there’s something at the back
of him—it would never surprise me if some day he went
off with that motor, and we never saw him again.”</p>

<p>“My dear sister! You know you are overwrought,
or you would never talk such rubbish.”</p>

<p>“If the motor was stuck in the middle of a river, I
should like to know how you and Aurea got out of it
without being half-drowned?” she demanded judicially.</p>

<p>“Oh, we got out of it very simply, and it was as
easy as kiss my hand,” rejoined Miss Susan, with a
gay laugh. “The only person that got wet was Owen;
he carried us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“<i>What!</i>” cried Mrs. Ramsay, with dancing eyes;
“carried you and Aurea—how?”</p>

<p>“Why, in his arms—where else? First he took
me, then he took her; and we were no more trouble
to him than if we had been a couple of babies.”</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word,” snorted Miss Parrett, casting
up her hands, “I think the whole thing is scandalous!
You and Aurea flying about the country, and spending
most of your time in the motor, going here and going
there, coming home at night alone in a carrier’s cart,
and telling me you left the motor in the middle of a river,
and that you were carried out of it in the arms of
the chauffeur! and that without a blush on your faces!
Upon my word, Susan Parrett, I don’t know what’s
coming to you! Either you are going mad, or you
are falling into your second childhood.”</p>

<p>Miss Parrett was profoundly relieved to see her
valuable car arrive on its own horse-power the following
afternoon. It certainly looked rather limp and sorry
for itself, and did not recover from its adventures in the
river for some time. Water had a fatal effect upon its
organisation; indeed, its condition became so serious
that it had to be sent to a garage, there to be overhauled—and
a bill, which was the result, proved one
of Miss Parrett’s favourite grievances for the ensuing
six months.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>TWO PRISONERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the middle of June Miss Susan had departed to visit
friends in the south of England, escorting her niece as
far as London, where she was to spend some weeks
with General and Mrs. Morven. The motor was in
hospital at Brodfield, and Owen, the chauffeur, had
absolutely nothing to do; no gardening, no greenhouse,
no car. Miss Parrett was now the undisputed ruler of
Ottinge—manor and village—and he kept out of her
way in a crafty, not to say cowardly, fashion; when
at home, Miss Susan and her niece had intervened as
buffers between him and Miss Parrett’s despotic rudeness.
Doubtless her bullying and browbeating were
a legacy from her burly grandfather, the Hoogly Pilot;
indeed, she was positively so insulting with regard to
repairs, his bill for petrol, and the extraordinary—the
incredible quantity he wasted, that sooner than face
her and have rows, he more than once paid for it out
of his own pocket! But do not let it be for a moment
supposed that the chauffeur was afraid of the old lady;
he was afraid of himself—afraid that if she became
altogether insupportable, he might lose, in one and the
same moment, his temper, and his situation!</p>

<p>When Bella Parrett reigned alone, it was a sore time
for the Manor, and especially for Joss. The old lady
did not care for any animals or pets, save a venerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
green and blue parrot—her own contemporary. She
had accepted Joss, a gift from Mr. Woolcock, as she
was assured that, having no man living at the Manor, a
dog was a necessity in case of robbers, but chiefly because
Miss Parrett half suspected that the Martingales—neighbours
of the Woolcocks—were anxious to possess
the said amusing little puppy. Joss was often in disgrace;
but what could one expect of an idle young
dog, without companions, education, or pursuits? When
Susan was at home all went well; she looked after him
and screened his failings, and took him out—though
her sister frequently expostulated, and said—</p>

<p>“Now, I won’t have the creature attaching himself
to you, Susan; he must learn to know that he is <i>my</i>
dog!”</p>

<p>All the same, she never troubled about “her dog’s”
food or sleeping quarters, and it was actually Susan
who paid for his licence!</p>

<p>Now Susan was absent, also his good friend Aurea—and
Joss was in confinement and deep disgrace; even
before his friends’ departure he had been under a black
cloud. His youthful spirits were uncontrollable; Joss
had inherited the keen sporting instincts of his father,
with the intellectual faculties of his accomplished mother,
Colette, the poodle, and was both bold and inquisitive.
Recently, the wretched animal had chewed off the tail
of a magnificent tiger-skin, and concealed it, no one knew
where! Miss Parrett hoped he had eaten it—as it
was cured with arsenic—but more likely it had been
stored in one of his many bone larders. He had poked
his nose into a valuable jar, upset, and smashed it!
he had come in all wet and muddy from a rat-hunting
excursion in the river, and recouped his exhausted
energies by a luxurious siesta in Miss Parrett’s own bed—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
there was also a whispered and mysterious communication
respecting the disappearance of a best and
most expensive <i>front</i>, which had undoubtedly gone to
the same limbo as the tiger’s tail!</p>

<p>“The brute is worse than a dozen monkeys,”
declared his furious mistress, and he was accordingly
bestowed on a farmer, who lived miles away near Catsfield,
merely to return, accompanied by a piece of rope,
the same evening. After this, the word “poison” was
breathed; but luckily for Joss, Ottinge did not possess
a chemist. Finally he was condemned to a fare of cold
porridge, and solitary confinement in an empty stable—being
suffered to roam loose at night after the house
was closed.</p>

<p>The chauffeur and the brown dog had a good deal in
common; they were both young and both captives in
their way. Oh, those long, endless summer days, when
the young man hung about the yard, with nothing to do,
awaiting orders, unable to undertake any job in case the
car should be wanted. When he called each morning for
Miss Parrett’s instructions, and to ask if she would
require the motor, the invariable reply was that “she
would let him know <i>later</i>.”</p>

<p>The first time they met, Miss Parrett had taken a
dislike to the chauffeur, and this dislike had recently
been increased by an outrage of more recent date. She
had seen Owen, her paid servant, in convulsions of
laughter at her expense; yes, laughing exhaustively at
his mistress! This was on the occasion of a ridiculous
and distressing incident which had taken place one sultry
afternoon in the garden. The Rector and his daughter
were helping Susan to bud roses—a merry family party;
the chauffeur was neatly trimming a box border, Hogben
raking gravel, Miss Parrett herself, hooded like a hawk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
was poking and prowling around. All at once she
emerged from a tool-shed, bearing in triumph a black
bottle, which she imprudently shook.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what <i>this</i> is?” she demanded, in
her shrillest pipe. The answer was instantaneous, for
the liquor being “up,” there was a loud explosion, a wild
shriek, and in a second Miss Parrett’s identity was completely
effaced by the contents of a bottle of porter. The
too inquisitive lady presented a truly humiliating spectacle.
Hood, face, hands, gown, were covered with thick
cream-coloured foam; it streamed and dripped, whilst
she gasped and gurgled, and called upon “Susan!” and
“Aurea!”</p>

<p>As the stuff was removed from her eyes by the latter—anxiously
kind, but distinctly hysterical—almost the
first object to catch the old lady’s eye was the chauffeur,
at a little distance, who, such was his enjoyment of the
scene, was actually holding his sides! He turned away
hastily, but she could see that his shoulders were shaking,
and told herself then that she would never forgive him.
She bided her time to award suitable punishment for his
scandalous behaviour—and the time arrived.</p>

<p>The malicious old woman enjoyed the conviction that
she was holding this too independent chauffeur a prisoner
on the premises, precisely as she kept the detestable Joss
tied up in the stables. Joss rattled and dragged at his
chain, and occasionally broke into melancholy howls,
whilst the other paced to and fro in the red-tiled yard,
thinking furiously and smoking many more cigarettes
than were good for him.</p>

<p>Accustomed from childhood to a life of great activity,
to be, perforce, incarcerated hour after hour, awaiting the
good—or evil—pleasure of an old woman who was afraid
to use her motor, exasperated Wynyard to the last degree.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
The car was ready, he was ready; usually about six
o’clock Miss Parrett would trot out in her hood and
announce in her bleating voice—</p>

<p>“Owen, I shall not require the car to-day!”</p>

<p>Sometimes she would look in on a humble, fawning
culprit in the stable, and say, as she contemplated his
beseeching eyes—</p>

<p>“Hah! you bad dog, you <i>bad</i> dog! I wish to goodness
you were dead—and you shall wish it yourself before
I’ve done with you!”</p>

<p>It was not impossible that these amiable visitations
afforded Miss Parrett a delicious, and exquisite satisfaction.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Drum Inn closed at ten o’clock, and even before
the church clock struck, the Hogbens had retired; but
the former Hussar officer, accustomed to late hours, and
with the long summer night seducing him, found it impossible
to retire to his three-cornered chamber—where
the walls leant towards him so confidentially, and the
atmosphere reeked of dry rot. No, he must breathe the
sweet breath of the country, have some exercise, and
walk himself weary under the open sky.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hogben—who had now absolute confidence in
her lodger, and told him all her most private family
affairs—entrusted him with the door-key, that is to say,
she showed him the hole in which—as all the village knew—it
was concealed. Sometimes it was one in the morning
when the chauffeur crept upstairs in stockinged feet,
accompanied by Joss—yes, <i>Joss</i>! There were a pair of
them, who had equally enjoyed their nocturnal wanderings.
The dog slept on a bit of sacking, in his confederate’s
room, till Mrs. Hogben was astir, then he flew back to the
Manor, and crept through the same hole in the yew hedge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
by which, in answer to a welcome whistle, he had emerged
the preceding evening. Behold him sitting at the kitchen
door when the kitchen-maid opened it, the personification
of injured innocence—a poor, neglected, hungry animal,
who had been turned out of doors for the whole long
night.</p>

<p>These were delightful excursions: over meadows and
brooks, through deep glens and plantations, the two
black sheep scoured the country, and, as far as human
beings were concerned, appeared to have earth and
heaven to themselves. Wynyard roamed hither and
thither as the freak took him, and surrendered himself
to the intoxication that comes of motion in the open air—a
purely animal pleasure shared with his companion.</p>

<p>They surprised the dozing cattle, and alarmed astonished
sheep, sent families of grazing rabbits scuttling to
their burrows; they heard the night-jar, the owl, and the
corn-crake; bats flapped across their path, and in narrow
lanes the broad shoulders of Wynyard broke the webs of
discomfited spiders. The extraordinary stillness of the
night was what impressed the young man; sometimes,
from a distance of four or five miles, he could hear, with
startling distinctness, the twelve measured strokes of
Ottinge church clock.</p>

<p>During these long, aimless rambles, what Joss’
thoughts were, who can say? Undoubtedly he recalled
such excursions in ecstatic dreams. Wynyard, for his
part, took many pleasure trips into the land of fancy, and
there, amidst its picturesque glamour and all its doubts,
distractions, and hopes, his sole companion was Aurea!
Nothing but the hope of her return sustained and kept
him day after day, pacing the Manor yard, in a sense <i>her</i>
prisoner! His devotion would have amazed his sister;
she could not have believed that Owen, of all people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
would have been so enslaved by a girl, could have become
a dumb, humble worshipper, satisfied to listen to her laugh,
to catch a radiant glance of her dark eyes, and, when he
closed the door of the car, to shield her dainty skirt with
reverent fingers.</p>

<p>Presently there came a spell of bad weather, the rain
sweeping across the country in great grey gusts and
eddying whirls, moaning and howling through the village,
making the venerable trees in Mrs. Hogben’s orchard
quite lively in their old age, lashing each other with their
hoary arms, in furious play.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Wynyard to spend the entire
evening indoors over Mrs. Hogben’s fire, listening to tales
of when “she was in service,” though he was interested
to hear that Miss Alice Parrett as was—Mrs. Morven—“was
the best of the bunch, and there wasn’t a dry eye
when she was buried.” He also learned that Mr. Morven
was rich for a parson, and had once kept a curate, well
paid, too; but the curate had been terribly in love with
Miss Aurea, and of course she wouldn’t look at him—a
little red-haired, rat-faced fellow! and so he had gone
away, and there was no more regular curate, only weekends,
when Mr. Morven went abroad for his holiday. And
now and then Mrs. Hogben would fall into heartrending
reminiscences of her defunct pigs.</p>

<p>“Afore <i>you</i> come, Jack, I kep’ pigs,” she informed
him; “one a year. I bought un at Brodfield—a nice
little fellow—for fifteen shillings to a pound, and fattened
un up, being so much alone all day, I could never help
making sort of free with the pig, and petting un. He
always knew me, and would eat out of my hand, and was
a sort of companion, ye see?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Wynyard, though he did not see, for
in his mind’s eye he was contemplating Aurea Morven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Well, of course, he grew fat, and ready for the
butcher, and when he was prime, he had to go—but it
just broke my heart, so it did; for nights before I couldn’t
sleep for crying,” here she became lachrymose; “but it
had to be, and me bound to be about when the men came,
and the cries and yells of him nigh drove me wild; though,
of course, once he was scalded and hung up, and a fine
weight, it wor a nice thing to have one’s own pork and
bacon.”</p>

<p>Her companion nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Howsomever, the last time I was so rarely fond of the
pig, and his screams and carryings-on cut me so <i>cruel</i>, that
I made a vow, then and there, I’d never own another, but
take a lodger instead—and you, Jack, be the <i>first</i>!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m flattered,” rejoined Wynyard, with an
irony entirely wasted on his companion, who, with her
skirt turned over her knees, and her feet generously
displayed, sat at the other side of the fire, thoroughly
enjoying herself.</p>

<p>“Tom is out,” he said, and this remark started her
at once into another topic, and a series of bitter complaints
of Dilly Topham—Tom’s girl.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is, she’s mighty pretty, ain’t she?”
she asked querulously.</p>

<p>“She is,” he admitted. Dilly was a round-faced, smiling
damsel, with curly brown hair and expressive blue eyes—a
flirt to her finger-tips. It was also true that she did
lead poor Tom a life, and encouraged a smart young
insurance agent, with well-turned, stockinged calves, and
a free-wheel bicycle.</p>

<p>“I’d never put up with her,” declared Mrs. Hogben,
“only for her grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Why her grandmother?” he questioned lazily.</p>

<p>“Bless your dear heart, old Jane Topham has been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
miser all her life. Oh, she’s a masterpiece, she is, and lives
on the scrapings of the shop; she hasn’t had a gown this
ten year, but has a fine lump of money in the Brodfield
Bank, and Dilly is all she’s got left, and the apple of her
eye. Dilly will have a big fortune—only for that, I’d
put her to the door, with her giggling and her impudence,
yes I would, and that’s the middle and the two ends of it!”</p>

<p>When Wynyard had heard more than enough of
Dilly’s doings and misdoings, and the biographies and
tragedies of his predecessors (the pigs), he went over
to the Drum, listened to discussions, and realised the
prominent characteristics of the English rustic—reluctance
to accept a new idea. Many talked as if the world
had not moved for thirty years, and evinced a dull-witted
contentment, a stolid refusal to look facts in the
face; but others, the younger generation, gave him a
new perspective—these read the papers, debated their
contents, and took a keen interest in their own times.</p>

<p>Wynyard generally had a word with old Thunder,
and played a game of chess with Pither, the organist.
Captain Ramsay was established in his usual place—smoking,
silent, and staring. So intent was his gaze, so
insistently fixed, that Wynyard invariably arranged to
sit with his back to him, but even then he seemed to feel
the piercing eyes penetrating the middle of his spine!</p>

<p>One evening Captain Ramsay suddenly rose, and
shuffled out of his corner—an usual proceeding, for he
remained immovable till closing time (ten o’clock). He
came straight up to where Wynyard was bending over
the chess-board, considering a move, and laying a heavy
hand on his shoulder, and speaking in a husky voice, said—</p>

<p>“I say—<i>Wynyard</i>—don’t you know me?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>LADY KESTERS HAS MISGIVINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this amazing question the chauffeur started violently,
looked up into the anxious, sunken eyes gazing into his
own, and answered—</p>

<p>“No, to the best of my belief, I’ve never seen you
before—never till I came here.”</p>

<p>The man’s worn face worked with violent emotion—which
he vainly struggled to subdue.</p>

<p>“What!” he demanded, in a high, hoarse key,
“have you forgotten Lucknow?—and Jim Ramsay of
the Seventh? Impossible!”</p>

<p>Wynyard glanced at him and again shook his head.</p>

<p>After a long pause, expressive of indignant incredulity—</p>

<p>“Why, man alive, you and I were at school together!
Don’t you remember your poky little room over the
churchyard, and how we fagged for Toler, and played
hard rackets?”</p>

<p>As Wynyard still remained irresponsive, suddenly,
to his horror, the questioner burst into tears and
tottered unsteadily towards the door, wringing his
hands, uttering loud convulsive sobs, and exclaiming,
“As a dead man out of mind! As a dead
man out of mind! Tell them to sound the Last
Post!”</p>

<p>There was a loud murmur from the card-players,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and old Thunder, turning about and addressing the company,
said—</p>

<p>“Poor old chap, ’e’s worse nor ever. At school
together”—to Wynyard—“Lor’ bless me! why, ye might
be his son! I suppose ’e’s a stranger to ye, mister?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I never laid eyes on him before.”</p>

<p>“He’s a-going off his nut,” declared a voice from the
nap table; “he did ought to be put away—he did.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” agreed the organist, addressing Wynyard,
“his good lady won’t hear of it; but it’s my opinion
that he is no longer safe to himself or others—it’s the
loose and at-home lunatics that commit these awful
crimes ye read of in the papers, and makes your blood
run cold.”</p>

<p>Wynyard made no reply. He had more than once
heard Pither himself spoken of as a madman and a
crazy fellow; but <i>he</i> was merely eccentric. As for
Captain Ramsay, he was lost in conjecture as to how
that unfortunate and afflicted gentleman had got hold
of his <i>real</i> name?</p>

<p>This mystery was solved no later than the next
evening. In the lovely, soft June twilight he was
walking past the Claringbold’s empty farm, and here
came upon the captain, who was leaning over the gate,
and signalled imperatively to him with his stick.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he called out, and Wynyard stood
still. “You’ve been a puzzle to me for nearly six weeks—and
at last I’ve got you.”</p>

<p>“Got <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Of course you are Owen Wynyard; you and I knew
one another long ago. Why, man! we were schoolfellows,
almost like brothers, and afterwards, when our
two regiments lay in Lucknow—why, God bless me!
it’s over thirty years ago!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Captain Ramsay had got hold of his right name, but
otherwise he was a raving lunatic.</p>

<p>“You are Owen Wynyard, aren’t you?” he asked
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, but I don’t use the Wynyard here;
and I must beg you to keep it to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right; in one of your old scrapes, my boy!
Money scarce! Ha ha!” and he laughed hysterically.
“So you’re lying doggo from the Soucars, but why
<i>here</i>?”</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” he answered sharply.</p>

<p>“Come, come, don’t be so grumpy and short with
me, Owen. You were always such a rare good-tempered
chap. What has changed you, eh? Now, come
along home with me, and we will have a good ‘bukh’ over
old times,” and, as he spoke, his grasp—a fierce, possessive
clutch—tightened painfully on his prisoner’s arm.</p>

<p>“But,” objected the victim, “I was going for a
turn.”</p>

<p>“No, you are not; you are coming straight home
with me. My wife will be glad to make your acquaintance.
I forget if you’ve met her?” and he touched
his forehead. “I’m a little funny here, Owen. India,
my boy! she takes it out of all of us one way or another—teeth,
hair, liver, brains. Come on now—right about
turn!” he concluded facetiously.</p>

<p>There was no use in resistance or in having a violent
personal struggle with the lunatic—nothing for it but
to submit; and, in spite of his reluctance, Wynyard
was conducted, as if in custody, right up to the door of
Ivy House. Were he to refuse to enter, he knew there
would only be a scene in the street, a gaping crowd,
and an unpleasant exposure.</p>

<p>“Look, look, Tom!” cried Mrs. Hogben, pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
to the opposite house, “if the captain hasn’t got hold
of our young fellow, and a-walkin’ him home as if he
had him in charge—he has took a fancy to him, I do
declare!”</p>

<p>“There’s more nor one has took a fancy to Owen,”
remarked Tom, with gruff significance; “but, as to the
captain—well—I’d rather it was him—nor me.”</p>

<p>The captain entered his house with a latchkey and
an air of importance; there was a light in the square
hall, and a door at one side was ajar. He called out—</p>

<p>“Katie, Katie, come and see what <i>I</i> have found for
you!”</p>

<p>A door was opened wide, and there stood Mrs. Ramsay
in a tea-gown, with a little black Pom. in her arms. She
looked amazed, as well she might, but instantly dissembled
her surprise, and said—</p>

<p>“Good-evening—I see my husband has invited you
in for a smoke?”</p>

<p>“Smoke!” said Captain Ramsay, passing into
the drawing-room, and beckoning Wynyard to follow
him. As he did so, he glanced apologetically at the
lady of the house, and it struck him then that he was
looking into a face that had seen all the sorrows of the
world.</p>

<p>The room was furnished with solid old furniture, but
Mrs. Ramsay’s taste—or was it Miss Morven’s—had
made it a charming and restful retreat, with pretty,
soft wall-paper, rose-shaded lamps, flowers, a quantity
of books, and a few Indian relics—such as a brass table,
a phoolcarrie or two, and some painted Tillah work which
he recognised as made near Lucknow.</p>

<p>“Katie,” resumed her husband, after a pause, “I know
you will be pleased to hear I’ve met a very old friend,”
and he laid his hand heavily on Wynyard’s shoulder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
“Let me introduce Captain Wynyard—Owen Wynyard
of the Red Hussars. He and I were quartered together
in Lucknow, a matter of thirty-three years ago—why, I
knew him, my dear, long before I ever set eyes on <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>As he concluded, he gazed at her with his dark shifty
eyes, and Wynyard noticed the nervous twitching of his
hands.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m delighted to make your acquaintance,”
she said, with the utmost composure, though her lips
were livid. Jim was getting worse—this scene marked
a new phase of his illness—another milestone on the road
to dementia.</p>

<p>“We were inseparable, Katie, I can tell you, and
went up together for our leave to Naini Tal, and stayed
at the club, rowed in the regatta, had a ripping time,
and went shooting in Kumaon. I say, Owen, do you
remember the panther that took your dog near Bhim Tal—and
how you got him?”</p>

<p>Wynyard nodded assent—in for a penny, in for a
pound! He was impersonating a dead man, and what
was a dead dog more or less?</p>

<p>“Do you remember the cairn we raised over him, and
he was so popular, every one who knew him, that passed
up or down, placed a stone on it?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to go and smoke in the dining-room?”
suggested Mrs. Ramsay. “Jim, I’ll ring for
Mary to light the lamp, she does not know you are in.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I’ll go myself,” and he shuffled into the hall.</p>

<p>“He has taken you for some one else, of course, poor
fellow!” she said, turning quickly to Wynyard, and
speaking under her breath.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “for my father—but please
keep this to yourself—I’ve always heard I am extraordinarily
like him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Then humour him, humour him, <i>do</i>. You see how
bright and happy this imaginary meeting has made him.
Oh, it will be so kind of you to talk to him of India—he
loves it—how I wish you knew the country—you must
pretend, and I will coach you. Lucknow is very hot,
and gay, not far——”</p>

<p>“But I needn’t pretend,” he broke in, “I know the
country—yes—and Lucknow too. I was there with my
father’s old regiment.”</p>

<p>She stared at him for a moment in bewildered
astonishment.</p>

<p>“I say, you won’t give me away, will you?” he added
anxiously.</p>

<p>“No; is it likely? If you will only come and talk
to him of an evening now and then, it will be truly one of
the good deeds that will be scored up to you in heaven.
Ah, here he is, and the lamp.”</p>

<p>“Now come along, Owen,” he said briskly. “Here
you are, I’ve got my best tobacco for you. Let’s have a
bukh!”</p>

<p>And what a bukh it was! Captain Ramsay carried
on most of the conversation, and as he discoursed of old
friends, of shikar, of camps and manœuvres, racing and
polo, his sunken eyes kindled, he became animated; it
was another personality to that of the silent, drooping
figure known to Ottinge. Wynyard, as he listened and
threw in a word or two, could now dimly realise the good-looking
smart officer in this poor stranded wreck.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ramsay, who had brought her work and her
little dog, sat somewhat apart, beyond the shaded lamp’s
rays, listened, wondered, and inwardly wept. What
vital touch to a deadened mind had kindled these old
memories? What a mysterious organ was the human
brain!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>And the taciturn chauffeur, he too was changed—it
was another individual; he sat there, smoking, his elbow
on the table, discussing army matters (now obsolete),
notable generals, long dead and gone, the hills and plains
of India, the climate—that, at least, was unchanged—with
extraordinary coolness and adaptability. The
guest was playing the rôle of being his own father, with
astounding success. And what a good-looking young
fellow! she noticed his clear-cut features, the well set-on
head, the fine frame, the distinguished looking brown
hand that lay carelessly on the table. The scene was
altogether amazing; this sudden recognition seemed to
have aroused Jim from a long, long mental slumber.
Was it a sign of recovery—or was it a symptom of the end?</p>

<p>When at last Owen rose to go, Captain Ramsay made
no effort to detain him, but sat, with his head thrown
back and his eyes fixed on the opposite wall, lost in a
reverie of ghastly vacuity.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Ramsay who accompanied her guest into
the hall, and inquired, in her everyday manner—</p>

<p>“And when is the motor of Ottinge coming back?”</p>

<p>“I am to fetch it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then, in another voice, almost a whisper, she added—</p>

<p>“I am so grateful to you. My husband and your
father seem to have been like brothers—and you really
managed wonderfully. You have given Jim such
pleasure, and, poor fellow, he has so little!” Her eyes
were dim as she looked up, “Even I, who am with him
always, see a change. I am afraid he is growing worse.”</p>

<p>“Why not better?” asked Wynyard, with forced
cheerfulness. “Have you seen a mental specialist?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, long ago; his condition is the result of
sunstroke, and they said he—he ought to be—put away
in an asylum; but of course his home is his asylum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>Her visitor was not so clear about this, and there was
no doubt that now and then the captain’s eyes had an
alarmingly mad expression.</p>

<p>“Can you manage to come and see him occasionally,
or is it asking too much?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come with pleasure; I have my evenings off—the
car never goes out at night, as you may know; but
I’m only Owen Wynyard, late of the Red Hussars, in
this house, if you please, Mrs. Ramsay.”</p>

<p>“Of course; and I shall be only too thankful to see
you whenever you can spare us an hour,” and she opened
the door and let him out.</p>

<p>From this time forth there commenced an intimacy
between the chauffeur and the Ramsays. He not only
spent an hour now and then with the captain, smoking,
playing picquet, and talking over old times, but he gave
Mrs. Ramsay valuable assistance with her boarders,
treated bites, thorns, and other casualties with a practised
hand; on one occasion sat up at night with a serious
case of distemper; on another, traced and captured a
valuable runaway. He admired her for her unquenchable
spirit, energy, and pluck, and helped in the kennel
with the boy she employed, and undertook to exercise
the most boisterous dogs of an evening. These thoroughly
enjoyed their excursions with an active companion, who,
however, maintained a strict but kindly discipline; and,
of a bright moonlight night, it was no uncommon sight to
meet the chauffeur, four or five miles from Ottinge,
accompanied by, not only Joss, but by several of Mrs.
Ramsay’s paying guests.</p>

<p>The friendship between the captain and the chauffeur
naturally did not pass unnoticed, and the verdict of the
Drum was that the young fellow, having spare time on his
hands, had been “took on as a sort of keeper at Ivy House,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and gave a help with the kennel and the old man—and
the old man was growing worse.”</p>

<p>Leila had arranged to pay a flying visit to Brodfield
when her brother went there to fetch the motor, and he
found her awaiting him in a gloomy sitting-room of that
once celebrated posting-inn—the Coach and Horses.</p>

<p>“Three months are gone!” she said, after their first
greetings, “so far so good, <i>ce n’est que le premier pas qui
coute</i>!”</p>

<p>“There are a good many <i>pas</i> yet! It’s awfully nice
to see you, Sis, and be myself for once in a way,” and
then he proceeded to unfold his experience with Captain
Ramsay.</p>

<p>“Oh, how ghastly! The poor lunatic talking away
to you, and taking you for our father! Imagine him
recognising you by the likeness, and skipping thirty-three
years! No one else suspects you, do they?”</p>

<p>“His wife knows my real name, and that’s all; I had
to tell her, but she is safe as a church. Miss Susan has
been curious.”</p>

<p>“Bless her dear simple heart!”</p>

<p>“I say amen to that; but of all the mean, purse-proud,
tyrannical old hags, give me Bella Parrett! She’s
always bragging of her family, too, and her crest—in my
opinion it ought to be a civet cat!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Owen,” and she laughed, “it’s not often that
you are stirred to such indignation.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t know her.”</p>

<p>“Apparently not. Well, what do you say to a move,
and to better yourself? I believe I could find you a
capital place in Somersetshire, not so retired, more in the
world, and with quite smart people.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, I’ll stick to this now—anyway till
Christmas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“But, Owen, when the old woman and the motor
are so objectionable—by the way, I must inspect it
before you start to-morrow—why remain?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got the hang of the place now. I know the
people, I’ve comfortable quarters—and—er—I like Miss
Susan——”</p>

<p>“Do you like any one else, Owen, come?”</p>

<p>“I like the parson, and the schoolmaster, and Tom
Hogben.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” throwing herself back, “I see you
won’t give me your confidence! I am positively certain
there is some one in Ottinge you like much better
than the parson and the schoolmaster—or even Miss
Susan.”</p>

<p>“I swear there is not,” he answered, boldly confronting
her. (Aurea was not in Ottinge, but visiting her rich
London relatives, doing a bit of the season with, to borrow
the native term, “Mrs. General Morven.”)</p>

<p>Leila was puzzled. Owen, she knew, was a hopelessly
bad liar, and his face looked innocence itself.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a box for the theatre here—a company
on tour. We may as well go—you can sit in the back,”
she said, rising.</p>

<p>“All right; it’s to be hoped none of the Ottinge folk
will be there, and spot me!”</p>

<p>“Not they! Don’t you know your Ottinge by this
time? Is it likely that any one of them would come all
this way to see a mere play?”</p>

<p>“Miss Susan might, she loves an outing and any
little bit of amusement; but she’s not at home, and if she
was, she would not get the use of the motor.”</p>

<p>“The theatre is only across the square—it’s quite near,
so we may as well walk;” and they did. Lady Kesters
in a high black dress, her brother in a dark suit, passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
unnoticed among the crowd, and enjoyed the entertainment.</p>

<p>The next morning Lady Kesters left Brodfield by the
ten o’clock train for London, having previously inspected
the celebrated green gem at the garage. She even got into
it, examined it critically, and laughed as she descended.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a take in! What a shame to have
cheated those poor old women! Why, Owen, I believe it
must be years and years old!”</p>

<p>“And a bad machine always; strong when you want
it to be weak, and weak when it should be strong. Some
of these days it will play me a trick, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“What, that old bone-shaker! No, no. Well, I’m
afraid you must soon be starting—as you say Miss Parrett
awaits you, watch in hand—and so must I. It’s been
awfully good to see you, and find you are getting on so
well—‘a chauffeur almost to the manner born.’ Martin
takes a profound interest in our enterprise.”</p>

<p>“He keeps me supplied with lots of tobacco and A1
cigars. Tell him that Miss Susan asked me if I got them
in the village? and Miss Parrett, who is as sharp as a
razor, inquired how I could <i>afford</i> to buy them? I
ventured to offer a couple to the doctor—I told him they
were a present; he took them like a lamb, and asked no
questions.”</p>

<p>“What! does a lamb smoke? Well, I’ll tell Martin
how much his offerings are appreciated, and that you
really are fit—and quite happy, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell him that neither of you need worry about
me; I’m all right at Ottinge.”</p>

<p>But when, an hour later, Lady Kesters gazed meditatively
on the flying Midlands, with her thoughts concentrated
upon her brother, she was by no means so sure,
that he <i>was</i> all right at Ottinge!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE REASON WHY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> Ottinge had been dozing through lovely summer
days, Aurea Morven was enjoying a certain amount of
the gay London season. General and Mrs. Morven had
no family—Aurea was their only young relative, the
Parretts’ only niece, the parson’s only child; and,
though she was the light of the Rectory, he was not
selfish, and shared and spared her company. Besides,
as Mrs. Morven said, “Edgar had his literary work, his
large correspondence, his parish, and Jane Norris to
look after him, and it was out of the question to suppose
that a girl with such beauty and attractiveness was to
be buried in an out-of-the-way hole like Ottinge-in-the-Marsh—although
her father and her aunts <i>did</i> live
there!” Mrs. Morven, a masterful lady on a large
scale, who carried herself with conscious dignity, looked,
and was a manager—a manager of ability. She was
proud of the general’s pretty niece, enjoyed chaperoning
her and taking her about, and anticipated her making
a notable match; for, besides her pretty face, and charming,
unspoiled nature, Aurea was something of an heiress.</p>

<p>It seemed to this clear-sighted lady that her niece
was changed of late, her spontaneous gaiety had evaporated,
once or twice she had sudden fits of silence and
abstraction, and, although she laughed and danced
and appeared to enjoy herself, refused to take any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
her partners seriously, and shortened her visit by three
weeks!</p>

<p>Miss Susan had arrived at Eaton Place for a couple
of days. It was arranged by the girl that she and her
aunt were to leave town together—though the general
and his wife pleaded for a longer visit, offering Aurea,
as a temptation, a ball, a Windsor garden-party, and
Sandown—the filial daughter shook her head, with smiling
decision; she had promised the Padre, and, besides,
she wanted to get back to the garden before the best of
the roses were over! Theatre dinners were breaking up
at the Ritz, and a stream of smart people were gradually
departing eastward. Among the crowd in the hall, awaiting
her motor, stood Lady Kesters, superb in diamonds
and opera mantle. She and Miss Susan caught sight
of one another at the same moment, and Miss Susan
immediately began to make her way through the
throng.</p>

<p>“So glad to meet you!” gasped the elder lady.
“I called yesterday afternoon, but you were out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so sorry—I was down in the country. Do
come and lunch to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could, but, unfortunately, we are going
home. Let me introduce my niece, Aurea Morven—Lady
Kesters.”</p>

<p>Lady Kesters smiled and held out her hand. Could
this extremely pretty girl be the reason of Owen’s surprising
contentment? She looked at her critically.
No country mouse, this! her air and her frock were of
the town. What a charming face and marvellous complexion—possibly
due to the Marsh air!</p>

<p>“I have known your aunts for years”; and, though
addressing Miss Susan, she looked straight at Aurea, as
she asked, “And how is the new chauffeur suiting you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>The girl’s colour instantly rose, but before she could
speak, Miss Susan flung herself on the question.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well indeed—most obliging and civil—has
been quite a treasure in the house and garden.”</p>

<p>Lady Kesters raised her delicately pencilled eyebrows
and laughed.</p>

<p>“The chauffeur—<i>gardening</i>! How funny!”</p>

<p>“You see, Bella is so nervous in a motor, it is not
often wanted, and Owen likes to help us. We find him
rather silent and reserved about himself; he gives the
impression of being a bit above his place?” and she
looked at Lady Kesters interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you can tell me something about him—as
you said you’d known him for years?” continued
Miss Susan, with unconcealed eagerness. “I am, I
must confess, just a little curious. Where does he
come from? Has he any belongings?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear lady, do you think it necessary to
look into your chauffeur’s past! I believe he comes
from Westshire, his people—er—er—lived on my grandfather’s
property; as to his belongings—ah! there is
my husband! I see he has found the car at last, and I
must fly! So sorry you are leaving town to-morrow—<i>good</i>-bye!”
Lady Kesters now understood her brother’s
reluctance to leave Ottinge—she had seen the reason
why.</p>

<p>Miss Susan and her niece travelled down to Catsfield
together, were met in state by the motor and luggage-cart,
and created quite a stir at the little station. Miss
Morven had such a heap of boxes—one as big as a sheep
trough—that the cart was delayed for nearly a quarter
of an hour, and Peter, the porter, for once had a job:</p>

<p>The ladies found that, in their absence, the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
had awakened; there were large house-parties
at Westmere and Tynflete, and not a few smart motors
now to be seen skimming through the village. It was
a fact that several tourists had visited the church, and
had “tea” at Mrs. Pither’s, and patronised her neighbour’s
“cut flowers.” The old church was full on
Sundays, dances and cricket matches were in prospect,
and Miss Morven, the countryside beauty, was immediately
in enviable request.</p>

<p>Miss Parrett had relaxed her hold, so to speak, upon
the car, and lent it daily, and even nightly, to her niece
and sister; indeed, it seemed that she would almost do
anything with the motor than use it herself; and though
she occasionally ventured to return calls at a short
distance, it was undoubtedly pain and grief to her to
do so—and, on these occasions, brandy and heart-drops
were invariably secreted in one of its many pockets.</p>

<p>Owen, the automaton chauffeur, was the reluctant
witness of the many attentions showered upon his lady-love,
especially by Bertie Woolcock, who was almost
always in close attendance, and put her in the car with
many voluble regrets and urgent arrangements for
future meetings. He would linger by the door sometimes
for ten minutes, prolonging the “sweet sorrow,”
paying clumsy compliments, and making notes of future
engagements upon his broad linen cuff. He little
suspected how dearly the impassive driver longed to
descend from his seat and throttle him; but once he
did remark to the lady—</p>

<p>“I say, what a scowling brute you have for a
chauffeur!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Miss Susan looked on and listened to
Bertie’s speeches with happy complacency. Bertie was
heir to twenty thousand a year, and it would be delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
to have her darling Aurea living at Westmere, and
established so near home.</p>

<p>One evening, returning from a garden-party, Miss
Susan and her niece had a narrow escape of being killed.
Aurea was seated in front—she disliked the stuffy
interior, especially this warm weather; they had come to
a red triangle notice, “Dangerous to Cyclists,” and were
about to descend a long winding hill—the one hill of
the neighbourhood. Just as they commenced the
descent with the brake hard on, it suddenly broke, and
in half a second the car had shot away!</p>

<p>Wynyard turned his head, and shouted, “Sit tight!”
and gave all his mind to steering; he took the whole width
of the road to get round the first corner, and then the hill
made an even sharper drop; the car, which was heavy,
gathered momentum with every yard, and it seemed
impossible to reach the bottom of the hill without
some terrible catastrophe. Half-way down was another
motor. Wynyard yelled, sounded the horn, and flashed
by; a pony-trap, ascending, had a narrow escape of
being pulverised in the green car’s mad flight. Then, to
the driver’s horror, he saw a great wagon and horses on
the road near the foot of the hill, and turned cold with the
thought that there might not be room to get by. They
missed it by a hair’s-breadth, and continued their wild
career. At last they came to the level at the foot of the
slope, and Wynyard pulled up, after the most exciting
two minutes he had ever experienced. He glanced at his
two companions; they were both as white as death—and
so was he! Miss Susan, for once, was speechless, but at
last she signed that she wished to get out, and Wynyard
helped her to the bank, on which she collapsed, inarticulate
and gasping.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing Aunt Bella was not with us,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Aurea, and her voice sounded faint; “<i>this</i> time she really
would have died! What happened?” turning to Owen.</p>

<p>“The brake rod broke, miss—the old car is rotten,”
he added viciously.</p>

<p>“Old car!” repeated Susan, who, though her nerves
were in a badly shattered condition, had at last found
utterance.</p>

<p>“Very old and crazy—and you never know what
she is going to do next, or what trick she will play you—and
you ladies have been giving her a good deal of work
lately.”</p>

<p>“If you had lost your head, Owen!” exclaimed Miss
Susan.</p>

<p>“I hope I don’t often do that, miss,” he answered
steadily.</p>

<p>“If you had not had splendid nerve, we would all
have been killed; why, we just shaved that wagon by a
hair’s-breadth—that would have been a smash! We
were going so fast.”</p>

<p>He made no reply, but moved away to examine the
machine.</p>

<p>“Of course it would have been death, Aurea, and I
don’t want to go like that!”</p>

<p>“I should hope not, Susie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall be afraid when it comes—I
shall feel like a child whose nurse has called it away to
go to sleep; but I’d prefer to go quietly, and not like
some crushed insect.”</p>

<p>Wynyard, as he worked at the car, could not help
overhearing snatches of the conversation between aunt
and niece; the latter said—</p>

<p>“The other day I was watching a flock of sheep in
the meadows; the shepherd was with them, and they were
all collected about him so trustfully. By his side was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
man in a long blue linen coat. I said to myself, ‘There
is death among them; poor innocents, they don’t know it.’
That’s like death and us—we never know who he has
marked, or which of the flock is chosen.”</p>

<p>“He nearly chose us to-day—but he changed his
mind.”</p>

<p>Aurea nodded, and then she went on—</p>

<p>“As to that odious motor, every one says Aunt Bella
was shamefully taken in; but she would not listen to
advice, she would buy it—she liked the photo. The car is
medieval, and, what’s more, it’s unlucky,—it’s malignant!
and you remember when we met the runaway horse and
cart near Brodfield; I was sitting outside, and I declare it
seemed to struggle to get into the middle of the road, and
<i>meet</i> them! you remember what Goethe said about the
demoniac power of inanimate things?”</p>

<p>“Now, my dear child, that’s nonsense!” expostulated
Miss Susan. “I had a poor education, and I’ve never read
a line of Goethe’s; if he wrote such rubbish, I had no loss!”</p>

<p>“Well, you will allow that the car did its very best to
destroy us to-day! And Mrs. Ramsay told me a man
she knew recognised it by its number—and that it once
ran over and killed a girl on a bicycle, and the people
sent it to auction, where some one bought it for a song,
passed it on to Aunt Bella, and here it is!”</p>

<p>“The car will be all right now, Miss Susan,” announced
the chauffeur, touching his cap; “there are no more
hills, we are on the flat, and I can take you home safely;
but I’m afraid she will have to go to Brodfield again
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Owen, do you believe in a motor being unlucky?”
she asked, rising as she spoke.</p>

<p>“I can’t say I do, miss; I don’t know much about
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“What do you mean?—not know about motors!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” correcting himself, “I mean with respect
to their characters, miss; it’s said that there are unlucky
engines, and unlucky ships, and submarines—at least
they have a bad name. I can’t say that this car and I
have ever, what you may call, taken to one another.”</p>

<p>And with this remark, he tucked in Aurea’s smart
white skirt, closed the door, mounted to his place, and
proceeded steadily homewards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>OWEN THE MATCHMAKER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Undoubtedly</span> it was hard on Wynyard that, at a time
when his own love-affair was absorbing his soul and
thoughts, he should be burthened with the anxieties of
another—in fact, with two others—those of Tom Hogben
and Dilly Topham.</p>

<p>For some weeks Tom had been unlike himself, silent,
dispirited, and almost morose, giving his mother short
answers or none; yet, undoubtedly, it <i>is</i> galling to be
accused of a bilious attack when it is your heart that is
affected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hogben was dismayed. What had come over
her boy? Her lodger, too, was concerned, for Tom,
hitherto sober, now brought with him at times a very
strong suggestion of raw whisky! At last he was received
into his confidence—the communication took place over
an after-dinner pipe in the Manor grounds.</p>

<p>During the dog-days, the atmosphere of Mrs. Hogben’s
little kitchen was almost insupportable—such was the
reek of soap-suds, soda, and the ironing blanket; and
Wynyard suggested that he and Tom should carry their
dinner, and eat it in the old summer-house on the Manor
bowling-green.</p>

<p>“We’ll be out of your road,” he added craftily, “and
save ourselves the tramp here at midday.”</p>

<p>At first Tom did not see precisely eye-to-eye with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
comrade; he liked his victuals “conformable”—and to be
within easy reach of the loaf, pickle jar, and—though
this was not stated—the Drum!</p>

<p>But after one trial he succumbed. There was no
denying it was rare and cool in the old thatched tea-house,
and his mother, who was thankful to get rid of
“two big chaps a-crowding her up—so awkward at her
busiest laundry season,”—provided substantial fare in the
shape of cold meat and potatoes, home-made bread, and
cheese—and, for Tom, the mordant pickles such as his
soul loved. The pair, sitting at their meal, presented a
curious contrast, although both in rough working
clothes, and their shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>The chauffeur, erect, well-groomed, eating his bread
and cheese with the same relish, and refinement as if he
were at mess.</p>

<p>The gardener, exhibiting a four days old beard, and
somewhat earthy hands, as he slouched over the rustic
table, bolting his food with the voracity of a hungry dog.</p>

<p>They were both, in their several ways, handsome
specimens of British manhood. Hogben, for all his
clownish manners, had good old blood in his veins; he
could, had he known the fact, have traced and established
his pedigree back to King Henry the Sixth!</p>

<p>Wynyard’s progenitors had never been submerged;
their names were emblazoned in history—a forebear had
distinguished himself in the tilting ring, and achieved
glory at Agincourt.</p>

<p>Possibly, in days long past, the ancestors of these
two men had fought side by side as knight and squire—who
knows?</p>

<p>Having disposed of his last enormous mouthful,
closed his clasp-knife, and produced his pipe, Hogben
threw himself back on the seat, and said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Look here, mate, I want a bit of a talk with ’ee.”</p>

<p>“Talk away, Tom,” he replied, as he struck a match.
“You have fifteen minutes and a clear course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, five will do me. As fer the course, it bain’t clear,
and that’s the truth. It’s like this, Jack, I’m in a
mort o’ trouble along o’ Dilly Topham.”</p>

<p>Wynyard nodded, the news had not taken him by
surprise.</p>

<p>“An’ you, being eddicated, and having seen London
and life—and no doubt well experienced with young
females—might give me a hand.”</p>

<p>Wynyard nodded again—Tom was undoubtedly
about to make a clean breast of it. So he lit his cigarette,
and prepared to listen.</p>

<p>“Dilly and I was children together—I’m five year
older nor she—and my mother, being a widder, I had to
start to work when I was ten, with a milk round—and
indeed long afore—so my schoolin’ wasn’t much, as ye
may know! ’Owever, Dilly and I was always goin’ to
be married for fun; and she grew up a main pretty girl,
and then it was agreed on in earnest. Well, now she
gives me the go-by! Most days she won’t look near me,
and she never comes ’ere; she’s got a gold bangle from
some other chap, and when I ask about it, she gives me
a regular doing, and says I’m to mind me own business!
What do ye say to that? It’s the insurance fellow, I’ll
go bail, from Brodfield; if I catch him—I’ll—I’ll bash
’is ’ead in—so I will—’im and ’is legs! What am I to do—I
ask you as a friend?”</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, I’m not as experienced as you suppose,”
said Wynyard, after a thoughtful pause, “but, if I were
in your shoes, I’ll tell you just exactly my plan of
operations.”</p>

<p>“Ay, let’s have ’em right away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“First of all I’d have my hair cut, and trim myself
about a bit.”</p>

<p>“What! an old blossom like me?”</p>

<p>“Yes; shave that fringe of yours altogether, and
wear your hair like mine,” running his hand over his
cropped head. “I declare, I could not live with a mop
like yours! And you may not know it, Tom, but you are
an awfully good-looking fellow.”</p>

<p>“Eh—am I?” with slow complacency. “They do say
so of Ottinge folk; they are mostly of fine old blood, come
down in the world—and the only thing that’s stuck is the
features—especially the nose.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you anything about that, but I’m certain
of one thing—you must give up whisky.”</p>

<p>“Ay”—reddening—“must I so?”</p>

<p>“Don’t let it get a hold, or it may never leave you.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but sometimes when I’m down, the devil ’e
comes, and ’e says, ‘You go and ’ave a <i>drink</i>, Tom, it
will do you good’; and ’e keeps on a-whisperin’ ‘Go and
’ave a drink, Tom, go and ’ave a drink, Tom,’ and so I
goes at last, and ’as three or four!”</p>

<p>“Tell the devil to shut up, and do you go to the
barber.”</p>

<p>“’E’s away this week thatching,” was the amazing
reply.</p>

<p>“Well, when he comes back get shaved, and you
won’t know yourself! Then I’d like to give you one of
my old coats, and a tie, and a few collars—we are about
the same size—and Miss Dilly won’t recognise you; and
after that, mind you take no notice of her; but share your
hymn-book with Nellie Hann—ask her out walking of an
evening, and I bet you anything you like, you will have
Miss Dilly after you like a shot!”</p>

<p>“Well, mate, I’ll do it,” said Tom moodily; “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
it’s a tricky business walkin’ with another girl—she
might take notions—and if it falls out badly with Dilly,
I’ll drown myself, but thank you all the same.”</p>

<p>After a long and brooding silence, Tom struggled to
his feet and scratched his head—</p>

<p>“If ye understood what it was to be <i>set</i> on a girl—you
would know what a misery I feel; but you are not
built that way, as any one can see—and now I must go
back to my job, or I’ll have the old lady on to me. She
stands in the landing window, a-watching like a cat at a
mouse-hole. It’s not so much the work—as that she
likes to see us <i>a-slaving</i>. Well, I’ll take yer advice, and
I am much obliged to ye.” And, shouldering his spade,
Tom lurched away, with long uneven strides.</p>

<p>“Now, what did you do that for?” Wynyard asked
himself. “You silly idiot! giving advice and putting your
finger in other people’s pies. Why should you meddle?”</p>

<p>No answer being forthcoming from the recesses of his
inner consciousness, he rose and stretched himself, and
presently returned to his struggle with a contrary old
lawn-mower.</p>

<p>By chance, the very next evening, on the road to
Brodfield, Wynyard came upon Dilly and the insurance
agent; they were evidently about to part, and were
exchanging emphatic last words. He accosted them in a
cheery, off-hand manner, and after a few trivial remarks
about the weather, and the heat, said—</p>

<p>“As I suppose you are going back, Miss Topham, we
might as well walk together. May I have the honour of
your company?”</p>

<p>Dilly beamed and giggled, the agent glowered and
muttered inarticulately; but he was a little in awe of
the chauffeur chap, with his quiet manners, steady eye,
and indefinable suggestion of a reserve force never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
exerted—and with a snort and a “So long, Miss Dilly!”
he mounted his bike, and sped homewards.</p>

<p>Dilly was both amazed and enchanted. So, after all,
she had made an impression on this quiet, good-looking
Owen chap! and for him, did he wish to “walk out with
her,” she was ready—to speak the brutal, naked truth—to
throw over both Ernest Sands and Tom Hogben.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to have met you like this,” he said, as they
proceeded side by side.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she responded eagerly, “so am I—awfully
glad!”</p>

<p>“Because I want to have a word about Tom.”</p>

<p>“Oh—<i>Tom</i>,” with inexpressible scorn, “I’ve just
about done with Tom!”</p>

<p>“Done for him, you mean! You’re breaking his
heart; he’s a topping good chap, I know, for I live in the
house with him.”</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was a bitter disappointment for Miss
Dilly. So the smart chauffeur was merely talking to her
as a friend of Tom’s!</p>

<p>“I say,” he continued, “do you think it’s playing the
game to be carrying on with this other chap, if you are
engaged to Tom?”</p>

<p>“Who says so?” she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“He does—Ottinge does.”</p>

<p>“Laws! A lot of jangling old women! Much I care
what they say!” and she tossed her head violently.</p>

<p>“You need not tell me that.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she snapped.</p>

<p>“Because you meet a young man you are not engaged
to, and walk miles with him through the lanes after
sundown.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure! Why mayn’t I have a friend if I
choose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“It is entirely a matter of opinion; if I were in Tom’s
shoes, Miss Dilly, and knew of this evening’s outing, I’d
give you the chuck at once, and have nothing more to
do with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh—<i>you</i>!”—insolently—“they say you’re a sort
of half gentleman as has got into some trouble. Why
don’t you mind your own affairs? Come now!”</p>

<p>“Tom is my friend and my affair.”</p>

<p>“Bah! a working man and a gentleman—friends!
Go on!” and she stared at him defiantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is; and I won’t stand by and see his life
spoiled, if I can help it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” and she burst into sudden tears, “it’s
his mother as is spoiling it—not me.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t we pledged four year ago, and I took his
ring, and there’s Maggie Tuke engaged years after me,
and nicely set up in her own house now, with a gramaphone
and a big glass—yes, and Nellie Watkin too; and
I’ve got to wait and wait till Mrs. Hogben pleases. <i>She</i>
won’t give up Tom, so there it is! Oh, of course she’s
all butter and sugar to a good lodger like you, but she’s
as hard as a turnpike, and she’s waiting on till my grandmother
comes forward—and that she’ll never do. Why,
she grudges me a bit of chocolate, let alone a fortin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s it, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it, since you must know; and I tell you
I’m not going on playing this ’ere waiting game no longer—I’m
about fed up, as they say; I’m twenty-six, and I’ve
told Ernest as I’m going to break it off with Hogben.”</p>

<p>“Come now, which do you like the best?” asked
Wynyard, amazed at his own impertinence, “Tom or
Ernest?”</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, of course, but what’s the good?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Look here, will you promise not to hate me—and
will you let me see what I can do?”</p>

<p>For a moment she gazed at him with an air of profound
mistrust; at last she muttered in a peevish voice—</p>

<p>“Yes, you can’t make things no worse, anyway—and
that’s certain sure.”</p>

<p>This was not a very gracious permission, but Miss
Topham wiped her eyes and held out her hand; at the
moment, by most provoking bad luck, the Rector and his
daughter dashed by in a dog-cart, and the former, recognising
him, called back a cheery “Good-night, Owen!”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that the fellow has cut out Tom
Hogben, and is making up to Dilly Topham?” he said to
his daughter.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” she answered stiffly.</p>

<p>“I should not have thought she was <i>his</i> sort; but one
never can tell! At any rate, she was crying and holding
his hand—there must be an understanding between
them, eh?”</p>

<p>But Aurea made no reply; apparently she was
engrossed in watching a long train of rooks flying
quickly homewards—drifting across the rose-tinted sky—and
had not heard the question. Her father glanced at
her; her pretty lips were very tightly compressed, one
would almost suppose that something had annoyed Aurea!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That evening, when Tom was at the Drum, Wynyard
had a serious conversation with Mrs. Hogben—a really
straight and private talk, respecting her son and his love-affair.
“If Leila were to see me now!” he said to himself,
“trying to engineer this job, how she would laugh!”
To his landlady he pointed out that one was not always
young, and that Tom and Dilly had been engaged four
years. (He had a vague idea that Tom’s wages and Tom’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
company all to herself, were considerable factors in his
mother’s reluctance to name the wedding-day.)</p>

<p>And for once Wynyard was positively eloquent!
He put down his pipe, and spoke. He pleaded as he
had never in his life pleaded for himself—he felt amazed
by his own arguments! Mrs. Hogben was thunder-struck;
generally, the fellow had not a word to throw
to a dog, and now to hear him talk!</p>

<p>“Think, Mrs. Hogben,” he urged, “what is Tom to
wait for? He has his twenty-five shillings a week and
this house—it’s his, I understand,” and he paused.
“If Dilly gives him up who will blame her? She has
waited—and for what?” Another dramatic pause.
“<i>You</i> are waiting for Mrs. Topham to die. She is likely
to hold on another ten or twenty years. You say this
is a healthy place—and she may even see you out; it’s
a way old people have—they get the living habit, and
hold on in spite of no end of illnesses. And I tell you
plainly that if Dilly throws over Tom—as she threatens—Tom
will go to the bad; and then perhaps you will be
sorry and blame yourself when it’s too late.”</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Hogben was in tears.</p>

<p>“And so I’m to turn out, am I?—out of the house
I was in ever since I married and the house where my
poor husband died of ‘roses on the liver’” (<i>cirrhosis</i>)
“and let that giddy girl in on all my good china and
linen,” she sobbed stertorously.</p>

<p>“No, not by any means—there’s room for all! I
shall not always be here, you know. Well, Mrs. Hogben,”
rising, “I hope you will forgive me for intruding into
your family affairs, but just think over what I have said to
you; you know I mean well, and I’m Tom’s friend,” and
with this declaration her lodger bade her good-night, and
climbed up the creaking stairs into his crooked chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>The immediate result of the chauffeur’s interference
was the transformation of Tom into a smart, clean-shaven
young man—who openly neglected his lady-love,
actually escorted her hated rival from evening church,
and remained to share the family supper of pig’s cheek
and pickles. Owen’s prescription had a marvellous
effect; for, three weeks after this too notorious entertainment,
it was officially given out at the Drum that
Tom and Dilly Topham were to be wed at Christmas—and
to make their home with Sally Hogben. On hearing
this, so to speak, postscript, various maids and matrons
were pleased to be sarcastic respecting the two Mrs.
Hogbens, and wished them both “joy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>SUDDEN DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> had been an outbreak of festivities in the neighbourhood
of lethargic Ottinge; the climax of these was
a grand ball given by Mrs. Woolcock at Westmere, to
celebrate her youngest daughter’s engagement to Lord
Lowestoff. Every one who was any one—and indeed
not a few nobodies—were bidden as guests; Mrs. Woolcock
liked to see her rooms crammed to suffocation.
No expense was spared—the arrangements were made
on a lavish scale. On this occasion the extra waiters
and other luxuries were imported from London by
special train, and a carefully selected house-party
provided the bride-elect with a ready-made court that
intervened between the future peeress and the vulgar
herd. Dancing took place in the great drawing-room
(in old days it was called the White Saloon), and through
its wide, open windows humble spectators—such as
coachmen and chauffeurs—were at liberty to look on,
to wonder, and to criticise.</p>

<p>The Misses Parrett and their niece were present.
Miss Parrett—who had nerved herself for the ordeal
with a glass and a half of port—had motored to Westmere
through the darkness, with great, flaring lamps—a
truly heart-shaking experience! but she was determined
to exhibit her new velvet gown and her new diamonds.
Her satisfaction with her own appearance was such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
that, before she embarked on her venture into the night
and the motor, her household were summoned to a
private view—precisely as if she were a young beauty
or a bride!</p>

<p>The old lady, who bore an absurd resemblance to a
black velvet penwiper, enjoyed the ball immensely, and
took a number of mental photographs; she also “took
the wall” of various obnoxious people who had dared
to patronise her in her days of poverty. Her particular
satellites, stout widows and anxious-looking spinsters,
rallied around her, ardently admiring her toilette, and
listened patiently to her boring recollections of the balls
she had attended years ago; but, in point of fact, they
were more keenly interested in the ball of to-night and
their prospects respecting escorts to the supper-table.</p>

<p>Much as she was engrossed in herself and her own
importance, Miss Parrett could not help noticing that
her niece was singled out for special attention by Bertie
Woolcock. This, though a genuine satisfaction to her,
was no pleasure to her chauffeur, who, from a coign
of vantage on the lawn, commanded a capital view
of the gay scene—the illuminated room, the constant
circulation of black and white, and sometimes coloured,
figures. Among these Miss Morven was pre-eminent—the
undisputed beauty of the evening—wearing a filmy
white gown, with a sparkling ornament glittering in her
dark hair; she looked radiantly lovely and radiantly
happy, as she floated lightly by.</p>

<p>The chauffeur’s watchful eyes noted that she had
(quite unnecessarily) bestowed three waltzes on that
blundering elephant, Bertie Woolcock; how red and hot
he looked—more as if he were threshing than dancing!
What would <i>he</i> not give for just a couple of turns with
the belle of the ball! The band was “Iffs” and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
floor seemed to be ripping! Well, there was nothing
for it but to wait as an outsider, and to hold on to his
patience with both hands.</p>

<p>After the great ball—its glories, shortcomings, surprises,
and failures—had died away into a nine days’
wonder, there were several cricket matches, and Ottinge
discovered, to its supreme elation, that they had a notable
man in Miss Parrett’s chauffeur! (This became evident
when the local eleven assembled for their evening practice
in the Manor fields.) The fame of Owen’s batting actually
brought old Thunder on the scene; for he, too, had
been a fine cricketer, long before gout had seized upon
him and he had subsided into carpet slippers.</p>

<p>“Ottinge <i>v.</i> Westmere” was a two days’ match, and the
last day at the park included a garden-party, arranged,
as Mrs. Woolcock murderously expressed it, “to kill off
all the neighbours!”</p>

<p>“I say, Miss Morven,” said Bertie Woolcock, greeting
her and her father on their very late arrival. “We are
catching it hot now, though Ottinge was nearly out at
three o’clock; that chauffeur fellow of your aunts’ has
made sixty runs for his side. I hope you sympathise
with us—we shall lose the match.”</p>

<p>“No, no indeed, Ottinge for ever!” she replied.
“Where is the chauffeur?” glancing round.</p>

<p>“Out in the field now.”</p>

<p>For some time she did not discover him, standing, a
good way off, bareheaded, and in well-fitting flannels.
He looked every inch a gentleman! What a contrast to
poor Bertie, who seemed, in comparison, a great slouching
yokel.</p>

<p>“He’s a good-looking chap, isn’t he?” said the Rector,
with the complacency of a man who is alluding to one of
his own parishioners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Yes,” admitted young Woolcock in a grudging tone,
“I suppose he is—a ladies’ beauty! One hears such a
lot of sultry stories, in these days, about women being
mashed on their chauffeurs, and runaway matches.
For my part, I call a chauffeur a rank idler—a chap who
sits all day, looks as solemn as an undertaker, and gets
spoiled by the ladies.” Then to Aurea, “Now, come
over to the tent, Miss Morven, my mother has kept a
place for you.”</p>

<p>The match proved close and exciting. Westmere
had a strong team, and Aurea looked on with intense
interest; the Park was in, and out in the field were Dr.
Boas, Hogben, Jones, Owen, and others. Time went on,
the last man was in, and making runs—the fate of
the match hung in the balance, when it was brought
to an end by a capital catch; Owen had not merely to
run at top speed, but to stoop suddenly to catch the
ball—a fine effort—which was loudly and deservedly
applauded.</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> knows all about it,” remarked a man who was
standing beside Aurea. “He is a public school boy, I’ll
bet my hat. What is he doing in Ottinge? A chauffeur!
Good Lord! Some young swell in disgrace with his
family.”</p>

<p>Miss Morven mentally endorsed this speech; but
actually she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>Miss Susan beamed at the victory—Owen’s triumphs
were hers. She felt as proud of his cricket and his songs
at the Parish Hall Concerts as if he had been her
own flesh and blood—other elderly spinsters have been
known to take young men into the recesses of their empty
and innocent hearts.</p>

<p>When the match was over, she kept her eye on the hero
of the occasion, and, seeing him getting into his coat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
preparing to depart, she beckoned eagerly, and then
hurried towards him with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“Congratulate you, Owen! I do feel so proud of
you!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss. I’m going to fetch the car—it’s
getting late.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me the time?”</p>

<p>He pulled out his watch from his breast-pocket, and
hastily touched—as luck would have it—the wrong
spring; the back flew open, and a small photograph, no
bigger than a finger-nail, fell upon the grass. In a second
Owen had put his foot upon it, swooped, and snatched it
up. Whether from stooping or otherwise, his colour was
higher than usual, as he boldly confronted Miss Susan,
whose face had become unusually grave—for, unless her
eyes deceived her (and she had capital sight) the treasure
was a photograph of her niece Aurea, cut out of a group
of “First Aid” recently taken at the Rectory! She had
recognised it in one lightning glance!</p>

<p>However, the chauffeur met her eyes imperturbably,
as he replaced the little scrap, opened the face of his
watch, and announced, with staggering self-possession—</p>

<p>“Half-past six, Miss Susan.”</p>

<p>Miss Susan turned hastily away, her maiden mind in
a violent commotion. So Owen, the chauffeur, carried
Aurea’s photograph about with him in his watch! What
did it mean? Well, of course, it could only mean one
thing, he was—and who could wonder—in love with
the girl! Yes, and the conviction gave Miss Susan a
violent shock; she was scandalised, she was pleased, and
she was <i>not</i> pleased—a peculiar and contrary state of
mind. She determined to keep the amazing revelation
to herself. Aurea must not be told on any account—it
might put disturbing ideas into her head—it would not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
proper; and for one whole week Miss Susan contained
her mighty secret, which secret disagreed with her both
mentally and physically. She was short and snappy—a
new phase of her character—ate little, avoided the
garden, and mainly subsisted on tea. At the end of
seven long days she found her endurance had reached
its limits, and, sitting with her back to the dim light
of the Rectory drawing-room, Susan Parrett solemnly
divulged to her niece the tale of her significant
discovery.</p>

<p>Was she shocked? Did she turn red and white?
No, indeed; Aurea received the astonishing information
with a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest Susie, what a tale! Why, it
was no more my photograph than yours! Am I
the only young woman that is known to Owen, the
chauffeur?”</p>

<p>This clever girl was so insistent and so amused that
she actually persuaded her deluded aunt that her eyes
had deceived her, and she had made a ridiculous and
silly mistake—yet all the time the girl’s own heart sang
to the tune that the story was <i>true</i>.</p>

<p>This silent chauffeur was a gentleman who had been
in the Service, and he carried her picture inside his watch.
These two facts were of profound interest to Aurea
Morven, and she turned them over in her mind many,
many times a day; the result being, that she held herself
as much as possible aloof from her aunts’ employé. When
she did avail herself of the car, it was never to sit, as
heretofore, outside by the driver, but within the stuffy
interior. She shrank from coming into contact with a
man who was seldom, to tell the honest truth, out of
her thoughts. To garden-parties and tennis tournaments
she now hailed her father, instead of accompanying Susan;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and together they drove in the Rectory dog-cart—this
arrangement entailing not a few excuses and pleadings,
that were not too firmly based on the truth—and the poor
forsaken car remained in the coach-house, or took Miss
Parrett out for a brief and agonising airing.</p>

<p>In consequence of all this, the car’s driver had more
time than ever on his hands! The summer days are long,
and, when off duty, he saw a good deal of the Ramsays.
The captain seemed of late to have sunk into a further
depth of mental lethargy, and to have lost much of
his affectionate interest in his old schoolfellow, Owen
Wynyard.</p>

<p>“I am giving up the dogs for the present,” announced
Mrs. Ramsay one morning at the kennels, as he brought
back three leg-weary companions. “I find I must not
continue what absorbs so much of my time and carries
me from home—though you are so good, and have
undertaken the three worst characters—they’re just as
wild as goats.”</p>

<p>“But I like them,” he declared; “they are capital
company, and give me an object for my tramps—these
two fox-terriers and the little beagle and I are great
chums. We have done a fine round this morning—they
have had the time of their lives! Just look at
them!” and she looked and smiled at their bespattered
legs, lolling tongues, and happy eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure of that,” she replied; “for they are
three town dogs! However, I must send the poor
fellows away, all the same. I want to be with Jim
altogether, and without his knowing it. You see,
he will never allow me to walk with him; and he always
fancies he is being watched, and looks behind him
every now and then. All the same, I mean to follow
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Wynyard listened in silence. Mrs. Ramsay was,
in his opinion, little short of a saint; for years and years
she had devoted her own individual life to this unhappy
madman. It was for him she slaved to increase their
small income, trading in plants and cuttings, and keeping
other people’s dogs. With the money she earned she
made Ivy House homelike and comfortable. The
captain’s food, drink, tobacco, and surroundings were
of a class that the exterior of the place did not seem to
warrant, and were accepted by him as a matter of course.
Nothing could induce him to believe that their income
was less than a thousand a year; he had no recollection
of his money losses. But this long-drawn-out effort and
strain was beginning to tell on his wife. There were
many white strands in her thick black hair, many lines
in her face; she had grown thin and haggard, her beautiful
Irish eyes were sunken, and wore an expression of
tragic anxiety. She alone knew what she dreaded,
and at last she put her fears into words—not to old
friends like the Parson, or Susan Parrett, but to this
recent acquaintance, this young Wynyard, who knew
so much already.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Owen, don’t you think that Jim looks rather
strange of late?” she asked him, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“No—much as usual.”</p>

<p>“He sleeps so badly, and has no appetite, and seems
horribly depressed. Oh, I feel miserable about him!”
and she buried her face in her thin hands.</p>

<p>“I wish I could do something, Mrs. Ramsay. Would
you like me to stop here at night—you know you’ve
only to say the word,” he urged, in a boyish tone that
was irresistible.</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, no; but it’s awfully good of you to
offer. It’s not at night, but when he is out by himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
that is so trying. I do follow as much as I dare. You
see,” now lowering her voice, “once this mental breakdown
of his took the form of suicide”—and here her
voice sank to a whisper—“he tried to hang himself in
Claringbold’s barn; but I caught him just in time, and
it never got out. That was years ago; and afterwards
he made a wonderful recovery. Now, it seems to
me more like a decay of will-power and memory, with
occasional outbreaks of violence—I can manage him then—but
it’s the dying of the mind!” and she gave a little
sob.</p>

<p>“If I may speak plainly, Mrs. Ramsay, I really
think you should get an experienced man to look after
him at once. I know nothing of mental disease, but I’m
sure it’s not right for you to be alone here with him, and
just two maids and old Mary.”</p>

<p>“You mean for me to get a keeper? No; I couldn’t
do it; and think of what people would suppose.”</p>

<p>Poor innocent lady! Did she imagine for a moment
that all Ottinge did not know for a fact that her husband
was insane?</p>

<p>“You might let them suppose he had come to help with
the dogs,” he suggested, after a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Of course—of course—what a splendid idea!”</p>

<p>“And you will send for him to-morrow, won’t you?
Or would you like me to wire or write to-night? I know
some one in London who would see about this.”</p>

<p>(Leila would have been considerably astonished if her
brother’s first commission from Ottinge was to dispatch
a keeper for a male lunatic!)</p>

<p>“I must consult Dr. Boas. Thank you very much.
I won’t do anything in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you? Why not? I think you should see
Dr. Boas at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Well, then, I will to-morrow. Jim complains of
his head—he often does, but now he says the pain is like
a saw, and he can’t stand it. Then he imagines he is
back in the Service, and expecting to be warned for
parade or a court martial, and talks very strangely. Dr.
Boas has gone away to a funeral, and won’t be back till
to-night, and then I must confess Jim doesn’t like him;
he likes no one but you, and some of the dogs—and <i>me</i>,
of course,” she added, with a sickly smile.</p>

<p>“Shall I come in this evening?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do; you <i>are</i> a kind fellow! Even if he never
speaks now, sure I know he loves to see you sitting there.
Ah, here he is, and I must go and coax him to eat some
dinner!”</p>

<p>To his visitor’s surprise, Captain Ramsay was unusually
animated and talkative that night, and mentioned many
little details about his father, and recalled certain daredevil
deeds, acts of generosity, and even nascent love-affairs.</p>

<p>“I say, Owen, you remember the pretty girl up at
Simla—the dark-eyed one you were so mad about—and
how you swore you’d run away with her, and marry
her in spite of her father, the General, and the whole
family? Oh, of course I know—what a duffer I am!
You eloped, tore down the hill by special dâk, and were
married at Saharanpore. Where is she now?”</p>

<p>Wynyard made no reply. Captain Ramsay’s wandering
memory had evidently evoked a vision of his dark-eyed
and remarkably pretty mother. She had run
away with the handsome Hussar officer, and had, in
consequence, been cast off by her relations.</p>

<p>“Dead?” inquired the other after a pause.</p>

<p>Wynyard nodded.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, we shall all be dead one day—some sooner—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
some later,” and he fell into one of his sudden
silences.</p>

<p>“I think he is better!” whispered his wife to Wynyard,
as they parted at the hall door. “Didn’t he seem
almost himself this evening? And he took great notice
of Topsy and Darkie, and made their dinner himself.”</p>

<p>Two days later, as the chauffeur was leaving Mrs.
Hogben’s cottage after his midday meal, preparatory to
getting ready the car, Mrs. Ramsay suddenly appeared
at her gate and beckoned to him frantically. She
looked white and frightened.</p>

<p>“Jim went off this morning,” she began, “and
hasn’t been home since. He never did this before. Oh,
I <i>ought</i> to have taken your advice,” and she wrung
her hands. “I’ve been searching for him since eight
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Did he speak to any one before he left the house?”
inquired Wynyard.</p>

<p>“No. Fanny saw him going out in a terrible hurry;
he had on a pair of white gloves, and said he would be late
for parade.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!”</p>

<p>“And the stupid girl never said one word to me till
she brought me my hot water at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I’m just off with the car, taking Miss Susan to a
croquet tournament, or I’d go and have a look round.
What about the policeman?”</p>

<p>“The policeman! Why, he cannot walk! He weighs
sixteen stone.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, if you don’t mind, I’ll send Tom
Hogben and Jones; they know the country, and will keep
a shut mouth. I’ll just tell them now,” and he hurried
away.</p>

<p>Although Miss Susan had no money wherewith to buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
diamonds, sables, and motor cars, she contrived to extract
a great deal of pleasure out of her elderly spinster life.
She enjoyed mild little tea-parties, followed by bridge
at sixpence a hundred—and received her partner’s scoldings
with disarming humility. Her one passion was
croquet. “Miss S. Parrett” was a notable player—her
name appeared in print in connection with local tournaments;
her arm was steady, her aim was deadly, and, not
only this, she played the game with her head as well as
with her hands.</p>

<p>On the present occasion Miss Susan had lured her
reluctant niece to a meeting at Upstreet—a village about
ten miles from Ottinge; in fact, she made such a point
of Aurea’s company, of Aurea’s support—whether in
success or failure—that the girl felt compelled to go—and,
at any rate, she took a sincere pride in Susan’s
modest triumphs. The tournament was prolonged till
seven o’clock; Miss Susan was detained, being in the
Finals. Dusk was closing on the world when the two
ladies, with two prizes (salad bowl and a silver cigarette-case),
took their departure. The prize-winner, in exuberant
spirits, uttering effusive expressions of enjoyment
and thanks, had talked herself into the car, and there were
so many after-thoughts and messages that even the
chauffeur became impatient with his dear Miss Susan;
he was desperately anxious to get home and hear the
result of the search for Captain Ramsay.</p>

<p>It was an unusually close evening—there was thunder
in the air—and the interior of the motor was stuffy even
with the windows down on both sides—and how they
rattled! The old machine trundled along at its best
speed, as if inspired by the fear of Miss Parrett awaiting
its arrival, watch in hand. Its driver had another and
more well-grounded dread in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>The ladies within discussed the recent party, the
play, the prizes, and the guests.</p>

<p>“The Wendovers were there; did you see them?”
said Miss Susan—“Mrs. Wendover and Gertrude. I
thought they both looked very ill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I believe it was from hunger, Susan,” was
her niece’s surprising reply. “I never saw such a tea as
they had—surreptitiously. It’s shameful to watch, I
know, but I was not playing, and happened to be sitting
near, and could not help myself. I felt so frightfully
sorry for them—I was inclined to cry!”</p>

<p>“My dear girl, surely you are not in earnest?”</p>

<p>“I only wish I wasn’t. Gertrude had a whole plate
of sandwiches, besides cakes; she took them quietly,
when no one was looking, and devoured them ravenously,
and her mother pocketed several buns and lumps of
sugar.”</p>

<p>“But why? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Because probably they have nothing to eat at
home! Mrs. Lucas, the parson’s wife, told me in confidence
that they are almost penniless; the little money
they had has been lost in some bank that tempted people
with high interest and then went smash. The Wendovers
cling to the old cottage—it’s their own—but they
have no servant; they do their own washing and,
very early in the morning, their own doorstep! Everything
is spick and span still. After dark they steal out
and collect firewood and apples, and even field turnips,
and yet they hold up their heads and ‘pretend.’ I heard
Mrs. Wade pressing them to have cake and tea—and they
declined.”</p>

<p>“Have they no friends or relations?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Mrs. Lucas said she did not like to
ask for their confidence. She always has them to supper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
on Sundays, and sends them eggs; but she is poor
enough herself with eight children. She thinks the
Wendovers will break down now that the winter is
coming, and yet they won’t allow any one to guess
that they are destitute.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, dear, how shocking! What <i>is</i> to be
done, Aurea?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just had my allowance, and I’ll post them
a five-pound note to-morrow anonymously, and I’ll
get something later on from dad.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes, and I must see what I can do too.
Poverty is cruel—a terrible thing—what a trial of one’s
character!”</p>

<p>“It is indeed, and so are riches sometimes. They
seem to change people’s dispositions—if they come in
for a fortune.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; but I do hope, dear child, you are not
thinking of your poor Aunt Bella?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Bella was much nicer when she lived in the
Red Cottage, dined at one o’clock, and put a penny in
the plate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, Aurea, I can’t let you say that; she is very
proud of you, and a dear, kind sister to me. Why, only
last week she gave me a lovely lace parasol, and when
she writes to me it is always ‘My own darling Susan.’”</p>

<p>Aurea was silent. She was thinking of darling Susan’s
many deprivations, humiliations, and hardships.</p>

<p>“We all have our foibles, have we not, Aurea, my
child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that, Susan, and I——”</p>

<p>Whatever Aurea was going to add was cut short by
her aunt’s piercing scream. From some thick bushes on
the left bank, a tall figure had shot out; there was a
lightning rush, a shout from the chauffeur, who jammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
on the brake, then a violent swerve, an upheaval, and a
sickening, crunching sensation.</p>

<p>A man had deliberately flung himself in front of the
car, which had gone over him, then stopped abruptly,
shuddering throughout its rickety frame.</p>

<p>The driver sprang off and dragged from beneath the
wheels a limp and motionless body. Yes, his vague fears
had been justified.</p>

<p>“It’s Captain Ramsay!” he called to Aurea, who
had already hurled herself into the road. “I’m afraid he
is done for. Stay where you are.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he raised a limp and bleeding figure in
his arms, which he carried to the hedgerow; next, he took
off his coat and laid him upon it, and ran and lit a motor
lamp. All his actions were surprisingly prompt and
vigorous.</p>

<p>“Now, will you come over here, miss?” he called to
Susan authoritatively, but she was almost beside him.
In a crisis, simple, talkative Susan was another person, and
could rise to the occasion. “And you, Miss Morven, try
and find some water—we passed a stream just now;
bring it in anything—your hat or—yes, the salad bowl!
I’m afraid it’s a bad business,” he continued, “and his
head is all cut—and his wrist—it’s an artery. Miss
Susan, fetch a stick quickly, quickly, and I’ll make a
tourniquet.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur seemed to have taken complete command
of the situation; he ordered the ladies hither and
thither, he bandaged up Captain Ramsay’s head with
Aurea’s white scarf—which he tore into strips—whilst
Aurea stood by, eager to help, but trembling like an
aspen. She had never heard a man moan, or witnessed
such a scene.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve fixed him up just for the moment,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Owen, rising, “and now I’ll fetch the doctor. You two
ladies won’t mind stopping, will you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not! What do you think we are made
of?” rejoined Miss Susan. “Here,”—now sinking down—“place
his head in my lap, and just go as hard as ever
you can!”</p>

<p>“He is in a very bad way, I’m afraid, and I really
don’t like leaving you, but there’s no help for it.” Then,
after sticking a flaring lamp on the ground beside them,
he climbed into his place and sped away.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour he had returned, accompanied
by Dr. Boas; they found the poor sufferer still alive and
moaning, his head supported by Miss Susan, and his lips
bathed by her niece.</p>

<p>“I half expected this,” said the doctor, as he
knelt beside Captain Ramsay. “Internal injuries,” he
announced, after a rapid examination, “and fatal.”</p>

<p>“The stretcher and the parish nurse will be here
presently,” said Owen; and, hearing a familiar voice,
Captain Ramsay slowly opened his eyes and asked—</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s cold. Where am I? Where’s Katie?”</p>

<p>As he recognised Owen bending over him, he
murmured—</p>

<p>“Wynyard, Wynyard—hold on—I’m coming!”</p>

<p>“You see he is off his head,” said Miss Susan, “poor
fellow; he did not know what he was doing.”</p>

<p>Then, as the chauffeur relieved her of the dying man’s
weight, he regained consciousness, and, again opening his
eyes, he whispered “<i>Wynyard!</i>” and passed away in
the arms of Wynyard’s son.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>BY THE SUNDIAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A long</span> time had elapsed since a tragedy or an inquest
had taken place in Ottinge; the last had occurred
twenty years previously, when Joe Watkins (a village
name), being jealous, had thrown his wife down a well,
and, despite her prayers, entreaties, and screams, had left
her to drown, for which crime he had paid the extreme
penalty of the law in Brodfield Gaol.</p>

<p>A suicide was something entirely foreign to the
character of the community, and the topic was exhaustively
debated in the Drum. Joe Thunder gave it as <i>his</i>
opinion that the remains of Captain Ramsay—speaking
from recollection—would be buried with a stake at a
cross-roads—probably at Crampton, being nearest. The
village was stirred out of its normal lethargy and, secretly,
rather proud of being the scene of a sensation, and newspaper
paragraphs.</p>

<p>The Parson and Miss Morven spent the night succeeding
Captain Ramsay’s death at Ivy House, and were
anxious to carry his widow off to the Rectory; but she
preferred to remain in her own home until after the
funeral, and then leave Ottinge. All Mrs. Ramsay’s
little world, gentle and simple, had shown her their kindness
and sympathy: the Rector looked after business
matters, Miss Susan had undertaken correspondence
(she enjoyed letter-writing), Wynyard took charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the dogs, whilst Aurea gave personal attendance and
warm affection.</p>

<p>The inquest was conducted as quietly and as speedily
as possible, thanks to the good offices of Dr. Boas; the
verdict returned was “suicide whilst of unsound mind,” and
the jury offered their sincere condolences with the widow.
At the funeral Ottinge was proud to note a lord and two
honourables appearing as mourners, and the remains of
Captain Ramsay received Christian interment in the churchyard;
there was no word of cross-roads—much less a stake!</p>

<p>Afterwards, Mrs. Ramsay’s brothers, who were guests
at the Rectory, took their departure, and it was generally
known that their sister would follow them to Ireland
within a week. Her obstinate persistence in for years
clinging to a man who by rights should be in an asylum
had alienated her friends; but now that he was no more,
there reigned a great peace. The boarder dogs had been
abruptly dispersed, and Wynyard, who obtained special
leave, personally conducted several parties over the
fields to Catsfield station, and wound up matters out of
doors. Aurea did the same within—but they rarely
met. She was surprised to discover the footing on which
her aunts’ chauffeur stood at Ivy House. Till now she
knew little of their acquaintance; it was a before-breakfast
and after-dark affair.</p>

<p>It was also Wynyard’s task to collect and sort and pack
the Captain’s belongings, by his widow’s particular desire.</p>

<p>“I like to have you about,” she said. “Is it not
wonderful how well we have got to know one another,
and how much we have in common, since I opened the
hall door to you, a stranger, that wet morning last April?
Jim was devoted to you, and you were so good to him—sitting
here, evening after evening, talking and listening
and playing picquet with that poor fellow. Oh, Owen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
if you had known him as your father and I knew him,
you would understand why I, forsaking all my own
people, clung to him till the <i>end</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did that!” he answered, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Only think of the tragedy of his life,” she resumed,
in a broken voice, “the last fifteen years, all through
a branch knocking off his sun topee and his determination
to get first spear. Oh, what a little thing to mean
so much! The way of life.”</p>

<p>Wynyard, the handy man, packed up cases containing
old Indian relics, such as faded photographs,
horns, bear skins, khaki uniforms, Sam Brown belts,
packets of tiger claws, and all sorts of rubbish dear to
Mrs. Ramsay. Among the collection was a photograph
album, aged at least thirty years, and considerably the
worse for Indian rains and Ottinge damp.</p>

<p>“I think this must be your father,” said Mrs. Ramsay,
pointing to the old-fashioned carte-de-visite of a handsome
man in Hussar uniform, “and this is your mother
opposite,” indicating a pretty, dark-eyed girl holding
up a puppy. “You see, she was fond of dogs, like you
and me! Do you care to have them?” drawing them
out as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you most awfully, I should. It’s
funny that I should come upon my people and hear
so much of them in Ottinge of all the world! I don’t
remember either of them, for my mother died when I
was two years old, and my father was killed at polo—it
killed her too—and then my sister and I were sent home.”</p>

<p>“So you have a sister?”</p>

<p>“I have very much a sister,” and he laughed; “she
has all the family brains—and her own as well.”</p>

<p>“I will not allow that, Mr. Wynyard; it was
marvellous how, with a few hints from me, you threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
yourself into a life before you were born. Isn’t it
strange that I am the only one in Ottinge who knows your
real name?”</p>

<p>“Except Miss Morven,” he corrected. “You know
he recognised me, and said ‘Wynyard.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, but no doubt she believes he was wandering.
You don’t wish your surname to be known here, do
you?”</p>

<p>“No, my christian name does as well.”</p>

<p>“I must confess I wonder you remain! You are
so young, and life here is deadly dull for such as you,
with all the years and energies before you,” and she
looked at him interrogatively. It was dusk; she was
sitting in the deep drawing-room window, her slim
figure silhouetted against the fading light. Wynyard
had been nailing down some cases, and came and stood,
hammer in hand, in the middle of the room. She knew
perfectly well why he remained in the sleepy village;
it was because Aurea Morven had glorified Ottinge.</p>

<p>“I believe I know your secret,” she remarked suddenly.
He made no reply. Mrs. Ramsay was no doubt
thinking of Aurea, whilst he was dwelling on the bargain
with his uncle. Should he tell her? They had of late
been drawn so much to one another—she already knew
half his story, and had just given him the photographs
of his father and mother—her husband and his father
had been like brothers—yes—he would!</p>

<p>And there in the semi-dusk, leaning his hands on
the back of a chair, in as few words as possible, he
related his tale, and how he had made a solemn compact
for two years, which compact he was bound to keep
to the letter and the bitter end.</p>

<p>“And it’s a good deal more bitter than I expected,”
he concluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>Listening with tightly folded hands, the slim figure
in black accorded him her entire sympathy. Now she
was in possession of all his confidence, and such was
his unhappy plight, he was desperately in love with a
girl, and could neither speak nor show a sign—nor make
his real position known. What an amazing state of
affairs! Did Aurea recognise in Wynyard a silent
worshipper? And was it not true that love and smoke
cannot be concealed?</p>

<p>“You will keep this to yourself, I know,” he said.
“I’m not <i>sure</i> that I’m within my right in telling you,
but somehow I had to.”</p>

<p>“You may be certain I shall never breathe it till
you give me permission,” she answered, drawing a long
breath; “but what an extraordinary man your uncle
must be!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is eccentric; but I believe he is right—this
sort of apprenticeship will do me a jolly lot of good. I
know more of the people now I’m one of them. Many
a thing I’ve learnt here, that I’d never have had a glimpse
of, and I must tell you fair and square that I gave
Uncle Dick a lot of bother in the way of my debts.”</p>

<p>“Hereditary extravagance—your father—a younger
son—drove a four-in-hand, you know. Ah, here comes
Aurea,” as the little gate swung. “I half promised
to go over there this evening.”</p>

<p>“Then good-bye, I’m off; I’ll finish the packing
to-morrow,” and he escaped through the back garden.</p>

<p>It was abundantly evident that of late Miss Morven
avoided him, and he had not spoken to her since the
tragic occasion when they both hung over a dying man
on the high road to Upstreet.</p>

<p>More than six months had gone by since he had
come to Ottinge; sometimes it seemed an endless time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
at others as but yesterday. One thing was clear and
stationary in his mind—his living among working people
had opened the eyes of a future landowner, given him
a better estimate of his responsibilities, and a sympathy
and understanding that nothing could obliterate.</p>

<p>At last Ivy House was closed; the blinds were drawn
down, the key hung in Mrs. Hogben’s bedroom, and
the memory of the recent catastrophe had become a
little dim. It was three weeks since the Captain had
killed himself, and other events had begun to press
upon public attention. Since the tragedy Aurea had
absolutely refused to drive in the motor, to her Aunt
Bella’s great annoyance; she was painfully anxious to
have it in daily use, for she feared that being the cause of
a man’s death might depreciate the car’s value! And
when the girl announced she would never get into it
again, she was furious, and her face assumed a dull red
shade as she asked—</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that, if there’s an accident
to a carriage, or if a cart runs over somebody, that cart
is never to be used? How could people get on?”
she demanded. “I never heard of such affected nonsense.
And now I suppose you will go and give my
nice car a bad name? As if it could help the madman
throwing himself under it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll say nothing about it, Aunt Bella, you know
that perfectly well; but if you had been in the motor
yourself and felt the <i>crunch</i>, I don’t think you would
have cared ever to drive in it again.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish—you are hysterical! You should get
Dr. Boas to give you a tonic and go away somewhere
for a change; only you are too much away from your
father as it is—every one says so. It was remarked to
me only the other day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“It is funny, Aunt Bella, how many people make
nasty remarks about me to you. Do you suppose that
they think you like hearing them?” and she laughed,
and before Miss Parrett could find her breath or an
answer had left her.</p>

<p>It was a fact that Miss Parrett cultivated a cordon
of idle, elderly women, who came to tea or lunch or
to spend the day, who were aware that Miss Parrett
had “a good deal in her power to bestow” (not only
in the form of fruit and vegetables), and who knew
that, even more than talking of herself and her wonderful
successes in her youth, her many broken-hearted
lovers, she liked to discuss her pretty, popular niece
and to listen to their hostile criticisms. Miss Parrett
was openly jealous of this girl’s ascendancy in Ottinge,
where <i>she</i> was the great lady. After all, Aurea was only
a sort of half-niece, and she could leave her money where
she liked. This notification was promptly repeated, and
received with unqualified and respectful approval,
by the two Miss Dabbs and Mrs. Forbes Cattermole
and her freckled daughters. On these occasions, when
Aurea was the topic, and her appearance, manners,
and customs were figuratively placed under the microscope,
and then exhaustively debated, the entrance of
Miss Susan was invariably followed by an abrupt and
awkward silence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was a lovely afternoon—Saturday—the third
day of September, and the chauffeur was working in
the Manor garden close by the sundial, repairing some
of the rose pergolas with nails and wire. Suddenly, to
his delight, he beheld Miss Morven coming through the
yew arch nearest to the house—a slim white figure in
a dark green frame—with her hat over her arm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
accompanied by Joss, who, in exuberant joy, was leaping
his own height from the ground.</p>

<p>As the young lady sauntered slowly up the broad
walk, she stopped every now and then to pick flowers
from the luxuriant borders on either hand. As these
were white, she was evidently gathering them for the
church. He watched, surreptitiously, her wonderfully
supple figure, her lithe grace, as she stooped and stretched
hither and thither. Aurea had grown thin, her lovely
colour had certainly faded, no doubt she had not yet
recovered from the shock of Captain Ramsay’s horribly
sudden death.</p>

<p>By and by his vicinity was discovered to her by
Joss, who had been dashing about among the cabbages
in chase of an historic pheasant, and now accorded him
a rapturous acknowledgment. He had just finished
his task, and stepped out into the walk; as the young
lady approached he touched his cap, and she halted
for a moment and said, with obvious hesitation—</p>

<p>“A lovely day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss;” and then he ventured to add, “You
never come out in the car now?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “never again; it’s a juggernaut!”</p>

<p>“I would not say that!” he protested. “What
happened could not have been helped; of course, it’s
an old machine and out of date”—(he was thinking
of the 60 h.p. Napier at Westmere)—“and requires a
lot of humouring to get her to run at all, and if put to
too high a pressure might go to pieces—still——”</p>

<p>But here Miss Morven interrupted with a hasty
gesture, and, laying her flowers upon the sundial, turned
to face him fully, and said—</p>

<p>“I’m rather surprised”—she paused for a moment,
and then resumed—“that when you saw what a dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
sort of place this was, and what a wretched old car you
had to drive, you stayed on. You really have no
proper job; my aunt’s motoring is absurd. I cannot
imagine why you remain here.”</p>

<p>“Can you not, miss?” he answered, in a low voice,
his gaze fixed on the sundial and its motto, “Time
Trieth All.” Suddenly raising his eyes, he met hers
steadily—for one unguarded moment the truth was in
his face!—and there was a thrill of passion in his voice
as he added, “Then, in that case, I am afraid it would
be impossible for me to tell you.”</p>

<p>For as long as one could count ten, there was an
expressive silence, only broken by the crashing of cabbage
leaves, the notes of wood pigeons, the boom of a passing bee.</p>

<p>Miss Morven remained motionless, but the trembling
of her lip indicated the tension of her self-control, and a
wave of sudden colour invaded her cheeks, and raced
up into her wavy dark hair. This tell-tale blush betrayed
that she knew as well as the chauffeur, his sole
reason for remaining in Ottinge.</p>

<p>Then without a word she lifted the flowers, and, holding
herself unusually erect, the slim white figure proceeded
down the walk that led towards the old bowling-green.</p>

<p>Wynyard, as he stood watching her, asked himself,
Was she also passing out of his life? In another moment
a yew hedge had hid her from his eyes.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ve done it now!” he muttered. “I
could not help it; she knows, and is ready to kill me
for my presumption! She will tell her aunts, and I
shall get the sack.”</p>

<p>He picked up a small blossom that Aurea had dropped
on the sundial, opened his watch, and carefully placed
the little flower along with the little photograph. When
people are in love, what irrational follies tempt them!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>AUREA’S REFLECTIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Aurea had no intention of “telling her aunts”; on
the contrary, she crossed the old bowling-green in order
to avoid the Manor, and returned home across the
meadows that led by Claringbold’s Farm. In the dim
hall of the Rectory she encountered Norris—who, of an
afternoon, often haunted that vicinity—and said, as she
handed her the flowers—</p>

<p>“Will you please fill the church vases? I’ve rather a
headache from the sun.”</p>

<p>The girl really did feel considerably dazed and bewildered,
and passed into the drawing-room, where she
ruthlessly dislodged Mac from her own particular pet
chair. Mac vacated the seat with an air of injured
deliberation, found another, and sighed as heavily as if
he were a human being.</p>

<p>The time had come for thinking things out, and his
mistress, having seated herself, prepared to hold a court
of inquiry on Aurea Morven. One would suppose that
she really had had a sunstroke like poor Captain Ramsay!
What mad impulse had urged her to question the chauffeur?
At the moment, she seemed to be listening to another
personality speaking by her lips. She felt a fluttering
in her throat as she told herself that this inscrutable
young man was certainly in love with her. Behold, she
summoned her evidence! The photograph in the watch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
the village concert, when, after a rousing camp song, he
had given, as an encore, “I’ll sing thee songs of Araby”;
she believed that the words were addressed to herself,
that the singer was pouring out his soul to <i>her</i>. Possibly
other girls shared her conviction, and had taken it to
their tender and palpitating hearts. When the last note
had died away in a ringing silence, Ottinge recognised a
gentleman’s song and a gentleman’s voice; after a pause
of astonishment, there came a storm of belated clapping
and applause, and one or two timid female voices
were heard to cry out “Encore!” Some of the rustic
audience grinned, and declared that the words were no
good, and damned nonsense, but the tune was pretty
enough; it was whistled in the street within the week.</p>

<p>Aurea summed up the photograph, the song, and the
recent interview by the sundial; the recollection of
Owen’s voice, the look in his extremely expressive grey
eyes, set her heart beating. At the same time she
blamed herself for her amazing indiscretion. She, who
had lately avoided this gentleman chauffeur at choir practice,
at the Manor, and in the village—she, who
knew that he treasured her photo, to actually accost
him in the garden, and demand what he meant by remaining
in Ottinge!</p>

<p>She felt her face burning, and no wonder! Well, at
any rate the scene had given her a shock—it had roused
her to the knowledge of her own feelings. It was with
difficulty her maidenly reticence could put the thing into
thought, but it simply came to this—she had arrived, at
last, at the clear realisation that the daughter of the
Rector of Ottinge was in love with her aunts’ chauffeur!
She whispered it to herself and Mackenzie! How did
it sound? How would it sound when talked abroad,
all over the parish and the county? What would people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
say? When she thought of her Aunt Bella, she actually
laughed aloud, and Mackenzie, whom she had disturbed,
raised his head and gave a low growl.</p>

<p>The chauffeur disturbed her—even now her pulses
were racing; she had never felt like this when in the
company of Bertie Woolcock—no, nor any of Aunt
Morven’s young eligibles—but this man affected her
differently. Was it because she knew that he cared for
her? Was it because he was handsome, reserved, and
self-reliant? Was it because there was a mystery about
him? No; it was simply because he was himself;
his voice was still speaking to her inward ear—“It would
be impossible for me to tell you!” Nevertheless, his
eyes had been eloquent, and, since the truth must be
confessed, her heart was in a wild whirl of happiness.</p>

<p>But why was he here in retreat? Surely not because
he had done anything disgraceful? Mrs. Ramsay liked
him, and said he had been such a comfort to her husband
and herself; her father liked him, so did Susan, so did
the village; the dogs adored him—all but Mackenzie,
an exception who proved the rule!</p>

<p>Yes, she would give her heart to the chauffeur—as
a matter of fact it was not a case of giving; it was already
bestowed—and keep the knowledge to herself. No
one should ever know—above all, <i>he</i> should not know.
“Time Tries All.” His affairs might improve; some day
he might be able to throw off his chauffeur’s disguise and
be himself; meanwhile, she determined to avoid him,
and never again enter the Manor garden when there was
a chance of meeting him; as to the green motor, she had,
as she assured him, done with it for ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>AN HOUR OF LIBERTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> white flowers had been gathered on Saturday in the
Manor garden, and it was now Monday. Miss Parrett
had adventured a drive to Westmere, returning home by
four o’clock, and the car being washed and put away
betimes, the chauffeur found himself at liberty. The
glowing and golden September evening was enticing, and,
whistling for Joss, he set out for a good long stretch
before supper. On this occasion, man and dog deserted
the low country and the water-meadows, and climbed
the hills which sheltered the village. Their road lay by
a grassy cart-track, which ran sometimes between high
hedges, sometimes along a headland, with here and there
a hoary old gate—it was chiefly used in harvest-time
(indeed, wisps of fresh hay and straw were still clinging to
the bushes), and was the short-cut to Shrapton-le-Steeple,
a hamlet which lay eight miles south of Ottinge. The
track emerged upon a bare plateau, from whence was a
fine view of the surrounding country, and here was also
a sharp freshness in the air, which the man inhaled
with unmistakable enjoyment. Here, too, in the banks,
were inviting burrows, and these afforded the dog an
absorbing interest, as he drew their savour into his
nostrils with long-drawn sniffs of ecstatic satisfaction.</p>

<p>After a tramp of between three and four miles,
Wynyard threw himself down on a tempting patch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
grass, drew out his case, and lit one of Martin Kesters’
excellent cigars. His eyes roamed meditatively over
the broad landscape below, stretching away into the
dim distance—the spreading uplands splashed with orange
gorse, dotted with sheep and cattle, with here and there a
rust-coloured farmhouse, whose pale blue smoke lazily
ascended into the cool clear air. Wynyard enjoyed
the scene and the sensation of absolute freedom; at
least he was out of livery—he glanced at his shabby
tweed coat—beyond the reach of orders, and master
of himself! Not much to boast of! To think that
this job was the only one he could take on when driven
into a corner by circumstances and Uncle Dick! He
had no head, that was his trouble, although he could
keep it at a pinch—and wasn’t this what was called a
paradox? If he were only clever with his tongue
and his pen, like Leila, and had her talent for languages
and for organisation, her genius for saying and doing
the right thing!</p>

<p>As he unconsciously picked bits of grass, his
thoughts returned to Aurea and their recent meeting
in the Manor garden. Her confusion and her vivid
blush held for him a most stupendous significance.
Memory and imagination had magnified the occasion,
until it seemed to be the one important event in his
whole life!</p>

<p>If, by any chance, Aurea cared for him, and saw in
him something more than her aunts’ civil man-servant,
why should he not present himself in his true character?
The gruff replies in imitation of Tom Hogben were
surely an unnecessary handicap? Anyway, he had
let himself go on the night of the accident, hustling
and ordering on the spur of the moment, sending Miss
Morven for water, Miss Susan for wood—though no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
doubt they were both too much upset to have noticed
anything besides the tragedy.</p>

<p>Possibly a change of manner would make a difference,
and Aurea was so bright, and so wonderfully clear-sighted,
she might divine something of his situation, and wait.
“Wait!” repeated incredulous common sense, “wait
eighteen months till he had cast off his shackles!”
On the other hand, Bertie Woolcock loomed large.
Undoubtedly he would not wait, nor would Aurea’s
own relations. The Rector himself was a good, unworldly
old scribbler, but the people that mattered,
such as Miss Parrett and General and Mrs. Morven,
they would never allow their niece to refuse many
thousands a year and Woolcock, in order to keep faith
with a mysterious and penniless chauffeur. And Bertie
undoubtedly meant business; he was continually appearing
at the Rectory or the Manor, charged with
paltry messages and unnecessary notes—any excuse
or none served him! He even attended evening
church, where he openly and shamelessly worshipped
the Rector’s daughter, and not the Rector’s God.</p>

<p>As Wynyard contemplated Woolcock’s position
and the desperate obstacles that lay in his own path,
he picked many blades of grass. Naturally he disliked
his rival; he remembered him when he was in the upper
fourth at Eton, a big, loutish fellow—not of course in
Pop—and an awful duffer at games; who never did
anything for himself, that others could be bullied into
doing for him. “Woolly” was now a stout, sleek,
well-groomed man of thirty, with a heavy red face, a
lethargic manner, and—in the company of respectable
women—a great talent for silence.</p>

<p>Supposing that Aurea was talked over? Westmere
was a temptation. No; he could not face such a hideous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
possibility—yet he was penniless and gagged. Woolly,
a rich man and free; he, a prisoner to a promise and
in a false position—a position which compelled him to
touch his cap, not only to his lady-love, but to his rival!
and the latter salutation made him feel murderous.</p>

<p>Woolly had tons of money; he was so rich that
possibly he had never seen a penny! His attentions
to Aurea, his rides, his churchgoing, his marked civilities
to Miss Parrett, paraded themselves before Wynyard’s
mental sight—and the old Polly bird was all for the
match! Why, that very afternoon, as she was leaving
Westmere, she had held a long, mysterious “last word”
conversation with Mrs. Waring before she bundled
into the car, and squeaked out “Home—and go slowly!”
Meanwhile, Woolcock’s fluffy-haired sister stood on the
steps with her hands on her hips, a newly lit cigarette
in her mouth, the very embodiment of triumphant
satisfaction!</p>

<p>Undoubtedly a solemn treaty had been signed and
sealed. He had no powerful allies, how could he
interfere? His mind groped round the puzzle in confusion
and despair. If his own forefathers had not been
such crazy, spendthrift fools, he would not have found
himself in this maddening situation. To think that
his great-grandfather had lost thousands of pounds and
hundreds of acres, racing snails on the dining-room
mahogany, against another lunatic! However, the
original place still remained in the family, also the
most important heirlooms, and these were <i>pucka</i>
(good old Indian word!) and not those of other people.</p>

<p>If he could only hold on to the end, and put in his
time fairly and squarely, he might yet see Aurea at
Wynyard—though at present his prospects were blank;
all he had to his name was his weekly wages, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
wages, figuratively, bore him into the presence of Miss
Parrett. What an old bully she was! how she brow-beat
and hectored her unfortunate sister, and what
a jabbering impostor! talking incessantly of all she did,
and was going to do, but leaving everything in the
way of work to Miss Susan and her niece—whilst <i>she</i>
trotted round spying and scolding.</p>

<p>As Wynyard reclined against the bank smoking,
absorbed in his reflections—and Joss was equally engrossed
in an adjacent ditch—a far-away sound broke
faintly on their ears. In a few seconds this had resolved
itself into the regular “thud, thud, thud,” of a galloping
horse, and here he came into sight—a chestnut in a
lather, with streaming reins, and exultant tail, carrying
an empty side saddle.</p>

<p>Wynyard instantly recognised Aurea’s weedy
thoroughbred, and, flinging away his cigar, ran forward,
but the animal, bound for his stable, was not thus to be
captured and detained; with a snort of defiance, he made
a violent swerve, and tore on, hotly pursued by Joss.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>ON YAMPTON HILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not the horse, but the horse’s rider that was of
consequence. Where was she? What had happened?
Spurred by an agony of apprehension, Wynyard ran in
the direction from which the runaway had appeared.
In five minutes’ time a speck, and then a figure came
into sight, and this presently resolved itself into Miss
Morven—apparently unhurt. She, too, had been running;
her habit was splashed, she carried her hat in her hand,
her beautiful hair was becomingly loosened, and she had
a brilliant colour.</p>

<p>As Wynyard slowed down to a walk, she called to
him—</p>

<p>“Have you seen my horse?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he must be in Ottinge by this time,” was the
comforting rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stop him?”</p>

<p>“It would have wasted a lot of time, and I wanted to
see what had happened to you.—I was afraid you’d had
a spill.”</p>

<p>This was not the ever silent and respectful chauffeur
to whom Miss Morven had been hitherto accustomed;
but no less a person than Lieutenant Wynyard, late of
the Red Hussars, who, in a cheery voice, addressed her
as an equal—as no doubt he was. So be it. She instantly
decided to abandon herself to the situation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Possibly he would now confide something about himself,
and how and why he came to be in her aunts’ service.
So, after a momentary hesitation, she replied—</p>

<p>“Oh no, I only got off to open a gate, and Rufus
broke away. I suppose I shall have to walk home!”</p>

<p>To this Wynyard secretly and joyfully agreed, but
merely said—</p>

<p>“I see you are alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes; father and I rode over to Shrapton-le-Steeple;
he wanted to see Mr. Harnett, a literary friend, and
Mr. Harnett had so much to show and to say that he
persuaded father to stay and dine, as there is a moon,
and I came home by the short-cut. I must be three
miles from Ottinge?” and she halted and deliberately
looked about her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied; “a good three miles.”</p>

<p>(Oh, a very good three miles, during which he would
have Aurea’s undivided company—what a piece of luck!)</p>

<p>For some little time the couple proceeded in silence—a
sensitive silence. During the interval since their last
meeting, they had accomplished a vast amount of very
special thinking—many disturbing, dominating, and
dangerous thoughts had entered the young lady’s brain,
and she said to herself—</p>

<p>“I must keep perfectly composed, and if ever he
intends to speak freely, now—now is the time! To
think of us two alone on Yampton Hills, three miles
away from home!”</p>

<p>Somehow those three miles held a thrilling prospect.
Wynyard, for his part, was longing to utter what was in his
mind; here was his one grand opportunity; and yet for
several hundred yards a strange silence hung between them,
though the man was burning to speak and the girl was
longing to listen; meanwhile moments, precious as life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
itself, were ebbing fast! At last the conversation began
to trickle; the topics were the choir, the boy scouts, old
Thunder’s pig, and Mrs. Hogben’s face-ache—a spent
cartridge in the path introduced sport and shooting.</p>

<p>“I wonder why men are so keen on killing things?”
said Aurea.</p>

<p>“I believe we inherit it from our ancestors, who had to
kill wild creatures or starve. I must say I like shooting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you!”—a blank pause—“the only sport I
can imagine any pleasure in, is hunting.”</p>

<p>“Do you hunt?”</p>

<p>“No; I only wish I did; but Aunt Bella thinks it so
improper for a woman to follow the hounds, and father
could not escort me.”</p>

<p>“But parsons do hunt.”</p>

<p>“They did; a vicar of Ottinge actually kept hounds.
Father says he only left a dozen dusty books in the
library, but a hundred dozen of sound wine in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“Yes, those were the good old days!”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure that they were superior to our own
times. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“That I hope you will always have a good time, Miss
Morven.”</p>

<p>Miss Morven coloured and bit her lip, but resumed—</p>

<p>“If I only might hunt, I would be bound to have a
good time.”</p>

<p>“Is your horse a clever jumper?”</p>

<p>“No; he either blunders on his head, or sits down.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t sound very promising!” and they both
laughed. “Anyway, it’s a rotten, bad country,” said
Wynyard, with a contemptuous wave of his hand; “the
uplands are full of rabbit holes, and as for the lowlands—you’d
want a boat! You should see Leicestershire—big
fields and sound turf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Yes; but I’m afraid I can’t hunt in Leicestershire
from Ottinge,” she answered, with a smile; “and I have
some hopes of sport this winter. Mrs. Waring, who is
tremendously keen, wants me to go out with her.”</p>

<p>“On a pillion?”</p>

<p>“No; her brother has a capital horse, not up to his
weight, that would just carry me. He is so anxious
that I should try it; it jumps beautifully.”</p>

<p>“And what does Miss Parrett say?”</p>

<p>“I think Mrs. Waring may talk her over, and Mr.
Woolcock promises to look after me.”</p>

<p>This information roused Wynyard’s ire, his face
hardened, and his tone was dry as he said—</p>

<p>“Woolcock is too heavy to hunt, except pounding
along the road. He must weigh seventeen stone!”</p>

<p>“Very likely; but he is going to do a cure before the
season opens.”</p>

<p>“Why not a couple of hours with the garden roller,
and save the donkey?”</p>

<p>Miss Morven took no notice of this impudent suggestion—merely
flicked her habit with her hunting crop,
and he continued—</p>

<p>“Westmere is a fine old place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it? The hall and galleries are real Tudor,
and the park is lovely.”</p>

<p>“How would you like to live there?”</p>

<p>“I?” and as she turned to him her air was lofty.
“What a—a—an extraordinary question!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, with hasty penitence; “please
forgive me, it was more than extraordinary, it was
impertinent.”</p>

<p>“By the way (it was, after all, the girl who broke the
ice), I must ask you to excuse me for my inquisitive
question the other day in the garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“You wanted to know why I hung on at Ottinge, with
little or nothing to do?” and he paused. “I think
you do know, Miss Morven, in fact, I’m sure you know.
I’d be only too glad to speak out, but my hands and
tongue are tied. I’ve given a promise I’m bound to
keep, and between you and my absolute confidence,
there stands at present an enormous obstacle.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“I ought to tell you that I’m not what I seem.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” with a touch of impatience, “you are a
gentleman by birth; I’ve always known that.”</p>

<p>“Nor am I here in my own name—only my christian
name; but I’ve never done anything to disgrace it,
I give you my word of honour.” As he came to a halt
and faced her, and the setting sun shone into his truthful
eyes and touched his crisp brown locks, the glow of
the evening air seemed to give added force to his personality.
“I’ve played the fool—the silly ass—and
I’ve got to pay. How I wish I might talk to you openly,
and tell you all about myself!”</p>

<p>“I wish you might,” repeated the girl, and her voice
shook; an emotional tension had crept into the situation—her
pulses beat wildly, and her mind was in a tumult.</p>

<p>“You cannot imagine what it is to be in my fix,”
he continued, speaking with low, passionate intensity;
“for months and months to love some one with all my
soul, and never be able to open my lips.”</p>

<p>“It must be trying,” she answered, now moving on,
with her eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>“And when I’m free, I may be too late!” he said
gloomily.</p>

<p>“You may,” she assented; “for how could some
one guess?”</p>

<p>“That’s it! That is what is the awful part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
whole thing; but, look here, Miss Morven, let me state
a case. Supposing you knew a fellow in such a hole, and
felt that you cared for him, and could trust him and
stick to him, as it were, blindly for a time; supposing
he were your social equal, and had a clean record, and
that you knew he worshipped your very shadow—would”—and
here he looked straight into her face—“<i>you</i>
wait?” To this question, impetuously delivered, there
followed a silence.</p>

<p>“This is a sort of problem, isn’t it?” she faltered
at last, “like the Hard Cases in Vanity Fair?”</p>

<p>“No, by Jove, part of it is God’s truth! but I’m
only talking like an idiot. Of course no girl that ever
was born could do it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” she murmured, with her eyes on
the ground, her heart beating in hurried thumps.</p>

<p>“Miss Morven—Aurea,” he went on, now moved
out of all discretion, and casting self-control to the
winds, “you are the only girl I’ve ever cared for in all
my life. I fell in love with you the first moment I ever
saw you, when you danced with Mackenzie in the Manor
drawing-room. This meeting to-day has been the one
good turn luck has done me in three years—and I
seize upon it perhaps unlawfully; perhaps it’s not just
cricket, my talking to you in this way, but it’s my only
chance, so I snatch it, for I may never see you alone
again—and all is fair in love and war.”</p>

<p>At this moment he caught sight of a stout figure,
far below, labouring up the winding lane; it was Miss
Morven’s maid, Norris. He recognised her bright blue
gown. Oh, the precious moments were numbered, and
it was now—or never!</p>

<p>“What do you say?” he demanded, coming to a
standstill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“But what can I say?” she rejoined, lifting her
startled eyes to his. “I don’t know anything about
you. You cannot even tell me your name.” (Naturally
she did not mention that it was already known
to her.) “It’s all rather bewildering, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s simply crazy,” he admitted; “here am I,
your aunts’ chauffeur, receiving weekly wages, living
like a working man, telling you, with the most audacious
and astounding impertinence, that I’ve been in love
with you for months. You know that I’m of your own
class, but who I am, or where I come from, I refuse
to disclose. No wonder you feel dazed.” They were
now within sight of the village and of Norris. “Look
here, Miss Morven,” he continued, and his voice was a
little hoarse, “I see your maid coming, and my priceless,
precious time is running out. Let me ask you one
question; supposing I were not Owen, the chauffeur,
but had fair prospects, good friends, and say a thousand
a year to start with—would you—marry me?”</p>

<p>Aurea knew perfectly well that she would marry
him if he had only a few hundreds a year, no prospects,
and no friends; but she took refuge in that nice, useful,
and evasive word “Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps”—he stooped and kissed her gloved hand—“perhaps—will
keep me going! Even if I don’t see
you, I shall <i>live</i> on that one little word for the next
eighteen months. I don’t suppose I shall have another
opportunity of speaking to you.”</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by Norris, who suddenly
appeared round a bend in the lane, puffing like a grampus,
her hat on the back of her head, and her face crimson
from exertion.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Aurea!” she screamed, as she halted
and held her fat sides, “such a cruel fright as you give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
me—and the three men gone by the road looking to find
your corpse! and I ran this way, after your horse come
home all loose and wild. Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“No; he only broke away when I was opening a
gate, and I had to walk,” replied the young lady with
wonderful composure.</p>

<p>Norris threw a sharp glance at the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“And couldn’t <i>he</i> have helped you? What was
he about?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, like yourself, I was looking for Miss
Morven,” he replied.</p>

<p>Norris turned from him with a sniff of disparagement,
and, addressing herself to her mistress, said—</p>

<p>“And where’s the Rector?”</p>

<p>“He is dining with Mr. Harnett.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, tut! And he will stay half the night
talking books, and there are a brace of grouse for
dinner—kept to the hour—and all he will get at
Harnett’s will be green vegetables, like a goat—he’s a
sexagenarian!”</p>

<p>At this Aurea laughed and the chauffeur smiled; he
was now walking alongside of Miss Aurea, as much at
his ease as if he were a gentleman! Norris turned on
him abruptly, and said—</p>

<p>“Look here, young man, you’d better be getting on—it’s
your supper-time, and Mother Hogben won’t
keep it hot for you.”</p>

<p>“It’s very good of you to think of my supper,” he
replied, with a touch of hauteur; “but I’m not in any
hurry.”</p>

<p>He spoke to her as her superior; his was the voice
and air of the ruling and upper class, and Norris’ dislike
to the insolent young ne’er-do-well suddenly flared into
active hatred. Meanwhile, he walked with them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
the very end of the lane, and opened the side gate for
Miss Morven and herself; and as he held it, he took off
his cap to Miss Aurea and said—</p>

<p>“Good-night—miss.”</p>

<p>As mistress and maid crossed the lawn, the latter
burst out—</p>

<p>“I can’t abide that young fellow, with his fine
manners and his taking off his cap like a lord! Miss
Aurea dear, I’m thinking the Rector would not be too
well pleased to see you in the lanes a-walking out like
any village girl along of your aunts’ chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“Norris, how dare you speak to me in such a
way!” cried Aurea passionately. And yet, why be
furious? She <i>had</i> been “a-walking out” precisely
like any other country girl.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well, dearie, don’t be angry. I’m only
giving you a hint for your good, and I know you are
a real lady, as proud as proud, and as high-minded
as a queen or an angel. Still and all, I’m mighty glad
that none of our <i>talkers</i> happened to come across you!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>LADY KESTERS AT THE DRUM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane Norris</span>, who had been Aurea’s nurse, was now
her maid and housekeeper, a most efficient individual
in both capacities. Jane was a woman of fifty, with
a round, fat face, a complacent double chin, a comfortable
figure, and a quantity of ginger-coloured hair—of
which she was unreasonably vain. Jane had also
a pair of prominent brown eyes (which gave the impression
of watchfulness), a sharp tongue, a very sincere
affection for her child, and an insatiable appetite for
gossip. She was left in sole charge of the Rector and
Rectory when Aurea was absent, and considered herself
a person of paramount importance in the community,
not only on account of her position at the Rectory,
but also for being the happy possessor of a real fur
coat, a gold watch, and, last, but by no means least,
considerable savings. Her circle was naturally contracted
and select; her intimates, the village dressmaker,
Miss Poult—who had many clients in the neighbourhood—Mrs.
Frickett, of the Drum; and Mrs. Gill, the
schoolmistress. (Mrs. Hogben, who took in washing,
needless to say, was not in her set.) Miss Norris had a
<i>flair</i> for uncloaking scandals, and was a veritable Captain
Cook in the way of making marvellous and unsuspected
discoveries. She had always been particularly anxious
to explore the chauffeur’s past and to learn what she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
called the “geography” of this young man. Hitherto
the young man had defeated her efforts, and baffled
her most insidious inquiries. He did not drink or
talk or give himself away; he did not carry on with
girls, or encourage them. Oh, it was an old head on
young shoulders, and there was something about him
that was not fair and square—and <i>she</i> was bound to
know it!</p>

<p>Miss Norris had been occasionally disturbed by a
vague apprehension (resembling some persistent and
irritating insect) that her mistress was interested in this
good-looking stranger, but she thrust the idea angrily
aside. Miss Aurea was not like those bold, chattering
minxes who were always throwing themselves in his
way! She was really ashamed of herself, and her
wicked mind. Of course, Miss Aurea would make a
grand match, and marry young Woolcock—who was
just crazy about her, as all the world knew—and <i>she</i>
would go with her as maid to Westmere Park. But
the vision of her young lady and the chauffeur talking
to her so earnestly in the hill lane had excited her fears,
and she resolved to give Miss Aurea something to think
of, and put her from speaking to the upsetting, impudent
fellow—who got more notice and made more talk in
Ottinge than the Rector himself!</p>

<p>Aurea, who had been accustomed to Norris ever
since the days of socks and strapped shoes, regarded
her as a friend, and even suffered her to gossip (mildly)
as she dressed her hair, for she said to herself—</p>

<p>“The poor thing has no one else to talk to all day
long”—Simple Aurea!—“being set in authority over the
other servants, and must have some safety-valve.”</p>

<p>The night after her walk with Wynyard, Aurea
slept but little; she was thinking, and wondering, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
happy. As she dressed, she was unusually abstracted,
and when Norris began her <i>coiffure</i>, she did not as usual
read the Psalms for the day, but sat with crossed hands
in a trance of meditation, whilst her maid brushed her
soft and lustrous locks. After twice clearing her throat
with energetic significance, Norris began—</p>

<p>“So Mrs. Ramsay is letting the house for six months,
I hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the languid reply.</p>

<p>“To a sort of county inspector; the chauffeur fellow
showed him in—<i>he</i> has a finger in every one’s pie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, Norris.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, he did a lot for Mrs. Ramsay,” she
answered, with significance. “He was in and out at all
hours—some think he is good-looking—and ladies like
him.”</p>

<p>“What ladies?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Miss Aurea, you know I don’t intend
any harm, but the talk is that your aunt, Miss Susan,
makes too great a pet of him. Why, half his day he’s
helping her in the garden or potting plants in the
greenhouse; and she lends him books, and talks and
makes a fuss of him, just as if he were in her own
station.”</p>

<p>Norris’ speech was so rapid, such a cataract of words,
that her young mistress had not been able to interrupt;
at last she broke in—</p>

<p>“How wicked of people!” endeavouring to wrench
her hair away. “Poor Aunt Susan—so good, unselfish,
and kind—not even spared! Oh, it’s too abominable!
I’m ashamed of you, Norrie; how can you listen to such
things?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Aurea, I said just what you said,
and that Miss Susan was too old; but they say there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
is no fool like an old one—and some folk <i>will</i> gossip. And
there was Mrs. Lambert, who married a boy that was
at school with her own son. You know there’s not
much to talk of here—now the Ramsays are gone.
As for the young man, as I told you to-night, <i>I</i> never
held a good opinion of him; he’s too secret and too
off-hand to please <i>me</i>. He goes out of a night for
exercise, so he says, walking the country till daybreak;
but that’s just a blind. Who is he with?—tell me
that?”</p>

<p>Aurea remembered, with a sudden stinging pang,
how she and her father had overtaken him one evening
escorting Dilly Topham. Dilly had been crying, and
she was holding his hand!</p>

<p>“Why, I saw him myself in the theatre at Brodfield,”
resumed Norris, “and he had a young woman with
him—so he had.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” bravely demanded Aurea, but
her lips were white.</p>

<p>“The two were in a box, and he sat back—but <i>I</i>
knew him—and afterwards they walked together to
the Coach and Horses Hotel, the best in Brodfield.
She was tall and slim, and wore a long coat and black
lace scarf over her head—I call it very bold in the public
street.”</p>

<p>“One of his friends,” explained Aurea, with a stoical
indifference her heart belied; and to cut short any
further disclosures, she released herself from her handmaiden’s
clutches and knelt down to say her prayers.</p>

<p>By a disagreeable and curious coincidence, Miss
Morven received that same evening ample confirmation
of Norris’ arraignment!</p>

<p>Lady Kesters had decided to pay her brother another
visit, and wrote to announce that, as she and Martin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
were within fifty miles, she would fly down to see him
for a few hours.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I’ll come to Brodfield by train and motor over.
Don’t breathe a word to the Parretts. I can put up
at the Drum and meet you there. I’ve ever so much
to say and hear; your letters are miserable, and I’ve
not seen you for more than two months. Martin is
off to America in October—he has to look after some
business—and I am going with him, as I want to see the
country, but I shudder to think of the crossing. Uncle
Dick is at Carlsbad. If you come over to the churchyard
about six to-morrow, I shall be there. I’ll hire a car
for the day and get back to Brodfield for the night,
and rush to Rothes next morning with the milk; if
you will make an appointment, I can meet you, and go
for a stroll and a talk.”</p>
</div>

<p>A smart Napier and a motor-veiled lady were not
now a startling novelty in Ottinge—it was the highway
to many places; but the 40 h.p. motor and lady who
put up at the Drum was a refreshing novelty—and a
novelty invested in mystery.</p>

<p>The Drum jutted out obtrusively; the front faced down
the road towards the Manor, and one side was parallel
to the street, and whoever entered or left was well in
evidence. Lady Kesters asked for dinner and a sitting-room,
as if such were a matter of course! The sole
sitting-room was just across the passage from the bar
and overlooked the street. It was oak-panelled,
very low, the walls were decorated with cheap prints
and faded photographs of cricket groups, there was a
round table, three or four chairs, and an overpowering
atmosphere of stale beer.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me see—I’ll have some tea and roast
chicken,” announced the traveller.</p>

<p>“Chicken, ma’am?” repeated Mrs. Frickett, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
her tone was dubious. “I don’t know as I can run to
that. The hens is roosting now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,”—impatiently—“bacon and eggs. I’ll
go and take a turn about the village.”</p>

<p>With her veil drawn over her face, Lady Kesters
walked out, went slowly up to the church, and critically
inspected the Parsonage. Then, just inside the churchyard,
she discovered her brother sitting on a tombstone.
As he sprang to meet her, she exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Are you smiling at Grief?”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Sis, this is most awfully good of you! How
are you? Very fit?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do come out of this horribly dismal rendezvous,
and let us go down one of the lanes, and talk.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you tired?”</p>

<p>“No, only hungry. I’ve ordered a meal at the
Drum. I’m tired of sitting in a train or motor, and glad
of a walk. Well, Owen, so far so good—six months are
gone—hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank goodness, but it’s been a pretty stiff
job.”</p>

<p>“An uphill business, and terribly dull! Again I
repeat, would you like to move? You could so easily
better yourself.”</p>

<p>“No, I stop on till the car breaks up.”</p>

<p>Lady Kesters raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Well, I can only hope that blest epoch will be
<i>soon</i>! I met Miss Susan, you know, and the crafty old
thing was fishing to find out who you are? She has
her suspicions, but I gave her no assistance. The
niece was with her—Miss Aurea——” She paused expressively,
then went on, “Owen—she’s a remarkably
pretty girl.”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Yes, I understand your reason for remaining in
Ottinge; it is beautiful—simplicity itself.” She looked
at her brother attentively. “Are you making love to
her?”</p>

<p>“I—her aunts’ chauffeur?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! <i>Are</i> you in love with her?” she
persisted. “Come, tell the truth, my dear boy. Why
should you not take <i>me</i> into your confidence? Are you?”</p>

<p>“Well—I am.”</p>

<p>“And she?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I tell you that I’m only her aunts’ chauffeur,
and my tongue is tied? All the same, Sis—it’s beastly
hard lines.”</p>

<p>“Then, Owen, you really ought to go away; you’ll
soon forget her and Ottinge. I’ll find you another
opening at once.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t stir yet,” he answered doggedly.</p>

<p>“You are wrong, and on your head be it! I wish
you could come out to America with us; but foreign
countries are barred.”</p>

<p>“Why are you and Martin off there?” artfully
changing the subject.</p>

<p>“Partly business—chiefly, indeed. He has not been
well, and I can’t allow him to go alone; but, anyway,
I’m looking forward to the trip. Tell me, how are you
off for money?”</p>

<p>“All right; I fare sumptuously on a pound a week
and washing extra.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you live on bacon? That’s to be <i>my</i>
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Bacon—eggs—fowl—steak. Mrs. Hogben is a
mother to me, and a real good sort.”</p>

<p>“I must say I think you look rather thin, Owen.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it; I’m as fit as a fiddle, and made sixty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
runs last week for Ottinge. They little dream that I was
in the Eton Eleven! Hullo! here are some people
coming. I say—what a bore!”</p>

<p>No less than two couples now approached arm in
arm; as they passed, they stared hard, and even halted
to look back.</p>

<p>“What <i>will</i> they think, Owen?” and she laughed
gaily.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a blow what they think!” he answered
recklessly; “but all the same you’d better return to the
Drum alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, mind you come in this evening—I start at
nine; you can pretend my chauffeur is your pal—pretend
anything!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m good enough at <i>pretending</i>; it’s now my
second nature! Joking apart, you ought to be going
back to the inn, and getting something to eat.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE OBSTACLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> seven o’clock Wynyard went boldly to the Drum and
inquired for the lady who was stopping there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frickett stared at him with a stony expression
in her dull grey eyes. She had heard of his airs and his
impudence from Norris.</p>

<p>“Will she see you?” she asked, and her tone was
aggressively insolent.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” was the ready answer; “it’s business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if it’s business——” and she gave an incredulous
sniff and, flinging open the parlour door, ushered him into
the presence of his sister.</p>

<p>Lady Kesters had removed her cap and motor coat,
and was seated at the table in a careless attitude, leaning
her head on her hand and smoking a cigarette. The
door was exactly opposite to the taproom, and the
assembled crowd enjoyed a rare and unexpected spectacle.
A woman smoking—ay, and looking as if she were well
used to it and enjoying herself—a lady, too—there was
a string of pearls round her throat, and the hand that
supported her dark head was ablaze with diamonds.
Ottinge had heard and read that females were taking to
tobacco, and here was the actual demonstration before
their gloating eyes. A fine, handsome young madam,
too, with a car in the yard—ay, and a friend to visit
her! They craned over to catch a glimpse of the figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
ushered in by Mrs. Frickett. The man’s back and
shoulders had a familiar look. Why, if it wasn’t
Owen, Miss Parrett’s chauffeur! The immediate result of
this astounding discovery was a deadly and expressive
silence.</p>

<p>Since Wynyard had parted with his sister he had
made up his mind to tell her all about Aurea. He longed
to share his secret with some one, and who could be better
than Leila? She would give him her sympathy and—what
was more—a helping hand; if any one could unravel
a hopeless tangle, it was she. After a little commonplace
talk, in a few abrupt sentences he commenced to
state his case.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed as he paused, and she dabbed
the end of her cigarette on the old oak table, “so it’s
all coming out now! You show your good sense, Owen,
in confiding in <i>me</i>—two heads are better than one. I’ve
seen the young lady; she is distractingly pretty—and I
think I approve.”</p>

<p>“Think!” The words were a text upon which her
brother delivered to his astounded listener an address of
such emotional eloquence, that she sat and stared in
bewildered silence.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he strode about the room, carried away
by his adorable subject—Aurea’s beauty, her cleverness,
her unselfishness, her simple and single-hearted disposition,
her good influence in Ottinge, her delicious voice,
and her entrancing smile. Oh, it was a wonderful relief
to share with another the raptures so long bottled up in
his own breast!</p>

<p>In the middle of his discourse, the door, which was
flung open to admit “two lemonades,”—Owen had warned
his sister against the deadly Drum coffee,—revealed
to a profoundly interested tap, young Owen, the shover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
“a-walkin’ and a-talkin’ and a-carryin’ on like old Billy,
and in such a takin’ as never was seen.”</p>

<p>“She’s his sweetheart, ’tis sure!” suggested one
sightseer.</p>

<p>“Nay, more likely his missus,” argued another; “she
was a-laughin’ at him!”</p>

<p>As the door closed Leila threw her cigarette into the
grate with a quick, decided gesture, and, leaning both
elbows on the table, said, as she looked up at her
brother—</p>

<p>“It’s an extraordinary entanglement, my dear boy.
You are in love—for the first and only time in your life.
Of course I can believe as much of that as I like!”</p>

<p>“You can!” His voice was sharp and combative.</p>

<p>“In love with an angel. I may tell you that she
really is a fellow-creature! You think she likes you, but
for one solid year and a half you may not impart to her
who you are, or where you come from, or even your name—I
mean your surname. You are at liberty to inform her
that you are ‘Owen St. John Willoughby FitzGibbon’—a
nice long string!—but must never breathe the magic
word ‘Wynyard.’”</p>

<p>“No, you know I can’t,” he answered irritably.</p>

<p>“You are her aunts’ servant now, though you will
be, if you live, Sir Owen Wynyard of Wynyard; but you
may not give her the faintest hint, as you must stick
to your bargain with Uncle Dick and he to his with you.
Now, let me consider,” and she held up a finger: “if
you speak, and reveal your identity, and become engaged,
you lose a fortune.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, a trifle dryly.</p>

<p>“If you don’t speak, you run a great chance of losing
the young lady! Mr. Woolcock is on the spot, and as
willing as Barkis. Westmere is close by—an ever-enticing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
temptation—and he has the goodwill of the girl’s
relations.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a true bill; it’s wonderful how you grasp
things.”</p>

<p>“What grounds have you for supposing the girl would
wait for eighteen months in absolute ignorance of who
you were? Have you ever spoken to her, as her
equal?”</p>

<p>“Yes, once,” and he described their walk two days
previously. “I stated a similar case; I made the most
of my time, and asked her what <i>she</i> would do under such
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“My dear Owen,”—and she looked at him with an
expression of wonder in her eyes—“I am simply staggered
at your presumption!”</p>

<p>“Yes, so was I; but, you see, it was my only chance,
and I snatched it.”</p>

<p>“And what did she answer. That it was evident
you were an uncertified lunatic!”</p>

<p>“No; she said ‘Perhaps.’”</p>

<p>“‘Je m’en vais, chercher un grand peut-être,’ as some
one said on his death-bed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk French—or of death-beds, Sis.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t. I see that your divinity is a clever,
modern young woman, who refuses to commit herself.
Look here, Owen, I won’t tease you any more; this
situation is such that it even baffles the activity of <i>my</i>
clever and contriving mind! I’m afraid I can do nothing
at present; but when we return from America, I shall
make a point of cultivating General and Mrs. Morven,
on account of the girl. I’ll cultivate the girl for your sake,
and ask her to stay in Mount Street. Possibly she may
open her heart to me, and tell me everything! I have
a wonderful knack of extracting similar confidences even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
from my housemaids! I shall listen sympathetically,
advise sagaciously, and urge her to stick to you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that once you take a thing in hand, Sis,
it goes like an express train; but you will be away for
six months—six months is a long time.”</p>

<p>“Time!”—springing to her feet—“and talking of
time, I must be off. Ring the bell, my dear boy, and
order the car at once.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Morven had been dining at the Manor. She had
endured a long, leaden evening playing draughts with
her Aunt Bella; she played so carelessly that Bella had
repeatedly huffed her, and eventually won with six
kings to the good! After their niece’s departure, the
sisters were for once unanimous in their opinion: they
had never seen Aurea looking so well, as that night.</p>

<p>“What a rose-blush complexion, what clear, glowing
eyes!” said Susan, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Miss Parrett, who was putting away
the draught-board, “she’s got <i>my</i> skin, and her mother’s
eyes. I’ve often been asked if I were painted!” she
announced, with serene complacency.</p>

<p>Susan felt inclined to say, “And <i>were</i> you?” but
her courage failed her. Bella could never see a joke!
She had no recollection of Bella’s beauty—Bella’s
complexion, as long as she could remember it, had been
the colour of mutton fat—but Bella was twenty-five
years her senior—and no doubt her bloom had withered
early.</p>

<p>“The girl looks to me—as if—as if——”</p>

<p>“Bertie Woolcock had proposed!” supplemented
Bella. “Yes, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>“No—not that.”</p>

<p>“Then what?” snapped her sister. “As if—and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
stop; it’s a dreadful habit not to be able to finish a
sentence—it shows a weak intellect.”</p>

<p>“Well, since you must have it, Bella—as if she were
in love.”</p>

<p>“So she is—with young Woolcock.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” repeated Susan, with unusual decision.</p>

<p>“Susan, don’t you dare to say ‘nonsense’ when <i>I</i>
say a thing is so; you forget yourself. Aurea will be
married to Herbert Woolcock before Christmas—that
is pretty well settled. And now you may lock up the
silver; I am going to bed.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As Miss Morven was proceeding homewards, and, as
usual, unattended (in spite of her Aunt Bella’s repeated
remonstrances), she passed the Drum, and noticed a
motor in waiting, and also a light in a conspicuous
part of the premises—the little, bulging, front sitting-room.
Here two figures were sharply outlined on
the yellow blind. As Aurea looked, she saw a man
and woman standing face to face; the man put his hands
on the woman’s shoulders and stooped and kissed her.
She recognised his profile in that instant—it was the
profile of Owen Wynyard!</p>

<p>Although brother and sister had taken leave of one
another, when they reached the car Wynyard looked
up at the sky and said—</p>

<p>“It’s a splendid night; I believe I’ll go on with you
to Brodfield, and walk back.”</p>

<p>The motor overtook Miss Morven as she reached
the Rectory gate; here she stood for a moment in the
shadow of the beech trees, and as the car and its occupants
swung into the full light of the last lamp (oil) in
Ottinge, she had a view of the back of the woman’s
head—a woman talking eagerly to her companion, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
faced her in an easy attitude, cigar in hand. The man
was her aunts’ chauffeur. As the car glided by, he
laughed an involuntary, appreciative, and familiar
laugh that spoke of years of intimacy—a laugh
that pierced the heart of its unseen listener with the
force and agony of a two-edged sword.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl felt stunned; then she began
to experience the shock of wounded pride, of insulted
love, of intolerable humiliation.</p>

<p>So the dark-haired lady was “the Obstacle!”
That impassioned declaration on Yampton Hill had
been—what? Mr. Wynyard was merely experimenting
on her credulity; he wished to discover how far
he might go, how much she would believe? A gay
Hussar, who had got into such trouble that he was
compelled to hide his whereabouts and name, until he
could return to the world after a decent interval of
obscurity and repentance! Meanwhile, he played the
mysterious adorer, and amused himself with “a country
heart,” <i>pour passer le temps</i>.</p>

<p>And yet—and yet—when she recalled his steadfast
eyes, the tremulous ardour of his bearing in the garden,
and, on the hillside, he had looked in desperate earnest.</p>

<p>“Yes,” jeered another voice, “and in deadly earnest
in the Drum window!”</p>

<p>And she? She had actually believed that he was
hopelessly in love; and she, who had been ready to stand
by him against all her kindred, who had blushed and
trembled before his eyes and voice, had kissed her
own glove where his lips had pressed it! As these
memories raced through her brain an awful sensation
of sinking down into the solid earth possessed her.
Aurea groped blindly for the gate and rested her head
upon it. It seemed to her as if, under the shade of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
beeches, a something not of this world, some terrible
and relentless force, had fought and wrested from her,
her unacknowledged hopes, and her happy youth.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she toiled up the drive with
dragging, unsteady steps. Prayers were over when
she entered the library—a white ghost of herself, and,
with a mumbled apology, she went over and bade her
father good-night, and touched his cheek with lips that
were dry and feverish. He, simple, blind man, absorbed
in proofs, barely lifted his head, and said—</p>

<p>“Good-night, my child, sleep well!”</p>

<p>And his child, evading Norris with a gesture of dismissal,
hurried to the seclusion of her own apartment,
and locked the door.</p>

<p>Three days later, Miss Morven left home somewhat
unexpectedly; but it was conceded even by her Aunt
Bella that the shock of Captain Ramsay’s death had
upset the girl. She wanted a change, and a lively place
and lively society would divert her mind.</p>

<p>Wynyard had not once seen her since their never-to-be-forgotten
walk, and the news of her departure
came as a shock—although his outward composure was
admirable—when he was informed that Miss Morven
had left home, to be followed by her father. The Rector
would return in three weeks, but Ottinge was not likely
to see his daughter for a considerable time. Miss Davis
had taken over the surplices, Miss Jones the girls’ sewing-class,
and Miss Norris the altar flowers.</p>

<p>Wynyard put artful and carefully guarded inquiries,
respecting her niece, to his friend, Miss Susan, who was
never reticent, and talked as long as she found a sympathetic
and intelligent listener.</p>

<p>“Well, indeed, Owen, I must confess Miss Morven’s
going was a great surprise,” she volunteered, in a burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
of confidence, as she swiftly snipped off dead leaves.
“I’d no idea of it till she came to me on Wednesday,
and asked me to help her pack, and take over some of
her parish accounts. She looked pale and not a bit
like herself; though she said she was all right, I didn’t
believe her. It struck me she had had some sort of
shock, she looked as if she hadn’t slept, but she wouldn’t
see the doctor, and was quite vexed at the idea. Dr.
Boas told me it was really the reaction of the dreadful
tragedy that she and I witnessed. So I’m glad she’s
gone, though I miss her terribly!”</p>

<p>And what was her loss to his? Wynyard had
believed he was on the point of establishing a firm if
inarticulate understanding—at least he had shown his
colours, and she had said “Perhaps.” This morsel
of comfort was all that remained to him; and oh, the
many, many things that he could and should have
said during that memorable walk! These unspoken
sentences tormented him with cruel persistency. Had
he wasted the opportunity of a lifetime?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>SCANDAL ABOUT MISS SUSAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> Aurea had departed—and her departure was,
as we know, in the nature of a flight—she had paid the
necessary visit of ceremony to her Aunt Bella, who
imagined herself to be busy making plum jam, but
was really obstructing the operations and straining the
forbearance of the new cook to a dangerous limit. The
old lady trotted into the drawing-room with sticky
outstretched fingers, and announced—</p>

<p>“Susan is out laying the croquet ground—the old
bowling-green; you may go and find her.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind sending for her, Aunt Bella.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you like giving your orders! Then
ring the bell. Well, and so you are off to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father will come up later; he has a good
deal of work in hand, and he wants to go over to Hillminster
once or twice.”</p>

<p>“I know; I’m lending him my car on Friday.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Bella, I do wish you’d sell it!” said Aurea,
speaking on an irrepressible impulse; “do get rid of it.”</p>

<p>“Rid of it! you silly, excitable girl, certainly not.
I’m more likely to get rid of the chauffeur; he does not
know his place, and he does other people’s jobs, too, in
my time. He exercised Katie’s dogs, and attended the
Hanns’ sick pony, and, when the carrier lost his horse,
I believe he doctored it and probably killed it—and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
sent round for subscriptions for another, <i>I</i> gave ten
shillings—handsome, I call it!—and what do you think
I saw in the list afterwards? ‘J. O., One Guinea.’ My
own servant giving double—such unheard of impertinence!
But Susan has spoiled him; I blame <i>her</i>. She
talks to him as if he were an equal; I declare, if she were
a girl, I’d be in a fine fright.”</p>

<p>Aurea maintained a pale silence.</p>

<p>“Yes; and Mrs. Riggs and others have remarked
to me that they really thought it was dangerous to
have such a good-looking young man about the place,
though <i>I</i> don’t think him good-looking—a conceited,
dressed-up puppy. Oh, here’s Susan. Susan,”—raising
her voice—“you see, Aurea sends for <i>you</i> now!”</p>

<p>“And welcome! Now, my dear child, come along;
I want to show you my—I mean—the new croquet
ground; it’s going to be splendid! Won’t you come
out and have a look at it?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Susan. It will be something to
see when I come back. Let me get your hat, and we
will stroll up together to the Rectory.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, my dear; but I’d like you to see
the croquet lawn. Owen has made it. He really is
worth half a dozen of Tom Hogben—and it’s as
level as a billiard-table.”</p>

<p>But nothing would induce Aurea to change her mind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Susan accompanied her brother-in-law over to
Hillminster, where he was due at a Diocesan meeting;
it was thirty miles off, and he had suggested the train,
but Miss Susan assured him, with eloquence, that “it
was ten times better to motor, and to go through nice,
out-of-the-way parts of the country, and see dear old
villages and churches, instead of kicking your heels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
in odd little waiting-rooms, trying to catch one’s cross-country
slow coach, and catching a cold instead.” It
happened that Mr. Morven had arranged to spend the
night with friends in the Cathedral Close, but Susan
Parrett was bound to be home before sunset; only on these
conditions was she suffered to undertake this unusually
long expedition with the precious car.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bella, I’ll be back without fail,” she declared;
“though I’d like to stay for the three o’clock service
in the Cathedral,” and she gazed at her tyrant
appealingly.</p>

<p>“Not to be thought of,” was the inflexible reply;
“you will be here at six.—Remember the motor must
be washed and put away, and the evenings are already
shortening.”</p>

<p>The run was made without any mishap, and accomplished
under three hours. It happened to be
market day in Hillminster, the main street was crowded
with vehicles, and Miss Susan could not but admire
the neat and ready manner in which their driver steered
amongst carts, wagons, gigs, and carriages, with
practised dexterity.</p>

<p>Presently they drove into the yard of the Rose Inn,
and there alighted. Mr. Morven and his sister-in-law
were lunching with the Dean in the Close, and Miss
Susan notified to Owen, ere she left him, that she proposed
to start at half-past two sharp, adding—</p>

<p>“For, if we are late, Miss Parrett is so nervous, you
know.”</p>

<p>The drive home began propitiously; but after a
while, and in the mean way so peculiar to motors, the
car, when they were about ten miles out of Hillminster,
and a long distance from any little village or even
farmhouse, began to exhibit signs of fatigue. For some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
time Wynyard coaxed and petted her; he got out
of the machine several times and crawled underneath,
and they staggered along for yet another mile, when
there was a dead halt of over an hour. Here Miss Susan
sat on the bank, talking with the fluency of a perennial
fountain, and offering encouragement and advice.</p>

<p>Once more they set out, and, before they had gone
far, met a boy on a bicycle, and asked him the way to
the nearest forge?</p>

<p>With surprising volubility and civility, this boy
told them to go ahead till they came to a certain finger-post,
not to mind the finger-post, but to turn down a
lane, and in a quarter of a mile they would come to the
finest forge in the country! The misguided pair duly
arrived at the finger-post, turned to the left as directed,
and descended a steep lane—so narrow that the motor
brushed the branches on either side, and Miss Susan
wondered what would become of them if they met a
cart? They crept on and on till they found themselves
in some woods, with long grass drives or rides
diverging on either side—undoubtedly they were now
on the borders of some large property! The lane continued
to get worse and worse—in fact, it became like
the stony bed of a river, and the motor, which had
long been crawling like some sick insect, finally collapsed,
and, so to speak, gave up the ghost! The axle had
broken; there it lay upon its side with an air of aggravating
helplessness! and it was after six o’clock by
Miss Susan’s watch!</p>

<p>“Now,” she inquired, with wide-open eyes, “what
is to be done?”</p>

<p>“We must go and look for some farmhouse; I’m
afraid you will have to pass the night there, Miss Susan,
unless they can raise a trap of some sort!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Oh, but I’m bound to get home,” she protested,
“if I have to walk the whole way. How far should
you say we were from Ottinge?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not very sure—I don’t know this part
of the country—but I should think about fifteen miles.
You might manage to send a telegram to Miss Parrett,—in
fact, I wouldn’t mind walking there myself, but of
course I must stick by the car.”</p>

<p>“See!” she exclaimed, “there are chimneys in the
hollow—red chimneys—among those trees.” And she
was right.</p>

<p>As they descended the hill, in a cosy nook at the
foot they discovered, hiding itself after the manner of
old houses, an ancient dwelling with imposing chimney-stacks,
and immense black out-buildings. Here Miss
Susan volubly told her story to a respectable elderly
woman, who, judging by her pail and hands, had evidently
just been feeding the calves.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as how I can help you much,” she
said; “this is Lord Lambourne’s property as you’ve got
into somehow. Whatever brought you down off the
high road, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“We were told to come this way by a boy on a
bicycle. We asked him to direct us to a forge.”</p>

<p>“The young limb was just a-making game of you,
he was! There ain’t a forge nearer than five miles,
and my master took the horses in there this afternoon;
he’s not back yet.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Miss Susan, “that you have
no way of sending me in to Ottinge—no cart or pony
you could hire me?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, ma’am. Where be Ottinge?”</p>

<p>Here was ignorance, or was it envy?</p>

<p>“Then I don’t know what I’m to do,” said Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Susan helplessly. “My sister will be terribly anxious,
and I’m sure the motor won’t be fit to travel for quite
a long time. What do you think, Owen?”</p>

<p>“I think that the motor is about done!” he
answered, with emphatic decision. “To-morrow morning
I must get a couple of horses somewhere, and cart her
home. I wonder if this good woman could put you up
for the night? This lady and I,” he explained, “went
to Hillminster from Ottinge to-day, and were on our
way home when the motor broke down; and I don’t
think there’s any chance of our getting to Ottinge to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I can put the two of you up,” she said,
addressing Miss Susan, “both you and your son.”</p>

<p>Miss Susan became crimson.</p>

<p>“I am Miss Parrett of Ottinge,” she announced,
with tremulous dignity; “that is to say, Miss Susan
Parrett.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I beg your pardon, Miss Parrett; I can
find you a bed for the night. This is a rare big house—it
were once a Manor—and we have several empty
bedrooms—our family being large, and some of the boys
out in the world. Mayhap you’d like something to
eat?”</p>

<p>“I should—very much,” replied Miss Susan, whose
face had cooled, “tea or milk or anything!”</p>

<p>At this moment a respectable-looking, elderly man
rode up, leading another horse.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Hetty,” he said to his wife, “I see you ha’
company, and there’s a sort of motor thing all smashed
up, a-lyin’ there in the Blue Gate Lane.”</p>

<p>“It’s my motor,” explained Miss Susan, “and we
have walked down here just to see what you and your
wife could do for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“Our best, you may be sure, ma’am,” rejoined the
farmer, and descended heavily from his horse, then led
the pair towards the stables, where he was followed by
Wynyard, who gave him a hand with them and borrowed
their services for the morrow.</p>

<p>A meal was served in the very tidy little sitting-room,
where Miss Susan found that places had been laid for
Owen and herself; it was evident that the farmer’s
wife considered him—if not her son—her equal! To
this arrangement she assented, and, in spite of his apologies,
Miss Susan and her chauffeur for once had supper
together without any mutual embarrassment.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he went out to a neighbouring farm to
see if he could hire a pony-trap for the following day,
and although Miss Susan was painfully nervous about
her sister, she was secretly delighted with a sense of
freedom and adventure, and slept soundly in the middle
of a high feather-bed—in a big four-poster—into which
it was necessary to ascend by steps.</p>

<p>Owing to vexatious delays in securing a trap, driver,
and harness, it was tea-time the next afternoon when
Miss Susan drove sedately up to the hall door at the
Manor.</p>

<p>Miss Parrett was prostrate, and in the hands of the
doctor! The telegram, dispatched at an early hour from
the nearest office to Moppington, was—on a principle
that occasionally prevails in out-of-the-way places—delivered
hours after Miss Susan had set the minds of
her little world at rest! There had been an exciting
rumour in the village—emanating from the Drum—that
“Miss Susan had eloped with the good-looking
shover,” at any rate no one could deny that they had
gone to Hillminster the day before, had probably been
married at the registry office, and subsequently fled!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
The Drum was crowded with impassioned talkers, Mrs.
Hogben was besieged, and the whole of Ottinge was pervaded
by a general air of pleasurable anticipation. One
fact was certain, that, up till three o’clock of this, the following
afternoon, neither of the runaways had returned!
However, just as it had gone four, here was Miss Susan—bringing
to some a distinct feeling of disappointment—seated
erect in a little basket carriage, drawn by an
immense cart-horse, driven at a foot pace by a boy;
and a couple of hours later she was followed by the
motor, this time on a lorry, and, undoubtedly, also, on
what is called “its last legs.”</p>

<p>When everything had been exhaustively explained
to Miss Parrett, she, having solemnly inspected the
remains of her beautiful green car and heard what its
repairs were likely to cost, heard also the price which
she would be offered for it—fifteen pounds—broke into a
furious passion and declared, with much vehemence
and in her shrillest pipe, that never, never more would
she again own a motor!</p>

<p>And, since the motor had ceased to be required,
there was no further use for a chauffeur, and once more
Owen Wynyard was looking for a situation.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>A NEW SITUATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> venerable green motor, whose value by an expert
had been so brutally assessed, was not considered worth
repair, yet Miss Bella Parrett could not endure to part
with a possession which had cost five hundred pounds,
for fifteen sovereigns; so it was thrust into a coach-house,
shut in the dark with cobwebs and rats, and
abandoned to its fate.</p>

<p>Miss Susan, who enjoyed motoring and liked the
chauffeur, was exceedingly anxious that Bella should
purchase another car, but of course she was powerless,
being next to penniless herself; indeed, at the outside,
her income amounted to one hundred a year—less income
tax. The mere word <i>motor</i> seemed now to operate
upon her wealthy sister as a red rag to a bull; for the
loss of five hundred pounds rankled in her heart like a
poisoned arrow.</p>

<p>The old lady had decided for a brougham, a middle-aged
driver, and a steady horse. (It may here be added
that the animal, which was coal-black and had a flowing
tail, came out of the stables of an undertaker, and was
as sedate and slow as any funeral procession could
desire.)</p>

<p>As for Wynyard, his fate was sealed! A chauffeur
without a car is as a swan upon a turnpike road. He
had had visions of proposing himself as coachman—for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
did not wish to leave the village, and the vicinity of
Aurea Morven—but Miss Parrett had other plans. In
her opinion Owen, the chauffeur, was too good-looking
to remain about the place—on account of the maids—and
indeed her sister Susan treated him with most
shocking familiarity, and spoke to him almost as if
he were her equal. Her quick little eyes had also
noticed in church that, during her brother-in-law’s most
eloquent sermon, the chauffeur’s attention was concentrated
upon her niece Aurea; and so, without any
preamble, she called him into the library and handed
him his pay, a month in advance, promised a first-rate
reference, and waved him from her presence.</p>

<p>And Wynyard’s occupation was gone! There
would be no more expeditions in the ramshackle old
motor, no more potting of geraniums for Miss Susan,
no more clipping of hedges, or singing in the choir. He
must depart.</p>

<p>Departures, to be effective, should be abrupt;
possibly Wynyard was unconscious of this, but the
following day he left for London; his yellow tin box
went over in a cart to Catsfield, whilst he walked to the
station across the fields by the same road as he had
come. His absence caused an unexpected blank in
the little community; the Hogbens regretted him
sorely, he was such a cheery inmate, and gave no
trouble. His absence was deplored at the Drum; the
village dogs looked for him in vain; his voice was missed
in the choir; other people missed him who shall be
nameless; and Joss howled for a week.</p>

<p>Wynyard had written to his sister to inform her
that, owing to the breakdown of the dilapidated old
car, he was once more out of a job, and found, in reply,
that she was on the eve of sailing for America. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
went round to see her in Mount Street, two days before
she started.</p>

<p>“You are looking remarkably fit, Owen,” she said,
“and the Parretts can’t say too much for you; indeed,
in Susan’s letter I observe a tone of actual distress!
Six months of the time have passed. I suppose you
have saved a little money?”</p>

<p>“I have twenty pounds in the bank, and a couple
of sovereigns to go on with. Of course I must look out
for another billet at once.”</p>

<p>“And on this occasion you will take with you a
really well-earned character. You have no debts
and no matrimonial entanglements—eh? What about
Miss Morven?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never laid eyes on her since I saw you.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“She’s been in London.”</p>

<p>“And now <i>you</i> are here—ah!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t follow her, as you seem to suppose. I
wasn’t likely to get another billet in Ottinge, and
anyway, I was a bit tired of having Miss Parrett’s heel
on my neck.”</p>

<p>“Tired of ‘ordering yourself humbly and lowly to all
your betters,’ poor boy! But to return to the young
lady; are you still thinking of her?”</p>

<p>Was he not always thinking of her? But he merely
nodded.</p>

<p>“You haven’t written?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m not such a sweep as all that!”</p>

<p>“But, Owen, didn’t you wring a sort of half promise
from the unfortunate girl? I know it was only ‘perhaps,’
but <i>château qui parle—femme qui écoute</i>.”</p>

<p>“I think it will be all right.”</p>

<p>“And that her ‘perhaps’ is as good as another’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
solemn vow! I must say you show extraordinary
confidence in yourself and in her, and yet you scarcely
know one another.”</p>

<p>“No, not in the usual dancing, dining-out, race-going
style; I give in to that, or, indeed, in the ordinary
way at all. She only saw me driving or washing the
motor, or doing a bit of gardening.”</p>

<p>“And you think you were so admirable in these
occupations that you captured her heart! Owen, I’m
seeing you in quite a new light, and I think you are
deceiving yourself. I expect the young woman has
forgotten you by this time. London has—attractions.”</p>

<p>“Time will tell; anyhow, she’s refused the great
Bertie Woolcock.”</p>

<p>“No!” incredulously, “who told you? When did
you hear it?”</p>

<p>“It was all over Ottinge a week ago, and I heard
it at the Drum. I was also given to understand that
Miss Parrett was fit to be tied!”</p>

<p>“If she had an inkling of her late chauffeur’s pretensions,
a strait waistcoat would hardly meet the
occasion. How I wish we could take you with us to
America; but it’s not in the bond. Martin has a great
deal of capital invested out there; he is not very strong,
and after we have put all his business through, we are
going to spend the winter in Florida. We shall not be
back before April, and then I will keep my promise.
I am so sorry, dear old boy, that I shall be out of the
country while you are ‘dreeing your weird’ and not
able to help you; but of course Uncle Dick’s great
object is for you to learn absolute independence. I
will give you my permanent address and a code-book,
and if anything happens for good or bad, you must
cable. We have let this house for six months—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
friends. We may as well have it aired, and have the
good rent! Every one lets now—even dukes and
duchesses! I wonder what your next billet will be?
You had better advertise.”</p>

<p>“What shall I say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Let me think.” After a moment she rose and
went to her writing-table, scribbled for a few moments,
and brought him the following: ‘As chauffeur, smart
young man, experienced, aged 26, steady, well recommended,
wants situation. Apply—— Office of this
paper.’ “Just send this to the <i>Car</i>, the <i>Morning Post</i>,
the <i>Field</i>, <i>Country Life</i>; it will cost you altogether
about twenty-five shillings, and I’ll pay for it.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Sis,” he protested, “that’s not in the
bond. And, as it is, you are keeping up my club
subscription.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” she exclaimed, “what’s that? I hope
this time you will get into a nice rich family who have
a good car, and that you will be able to have a little
more variety than in your last place, and no young
ladies. You will be sure and write to me every week?”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and Sir Martin
Kesters entered, and paused in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Owen, glad to see you,” holding out his
hand; “so you are back?”</p>

<p>“Only temporarily—for a day or two.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done six months, and the worst is over.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so; but one never can tell.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I don’t know how you stood it.
Leila described the place. I’m not a gay young fellow
of six-and-twenty, and a week would have seen me out
of it; but six months——” and he gazed at him in blank
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” apologetically, “I’ve learnt all sorts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
things. I’m quite a fair gardener, and can clip a hedge
too; I know how to physic dogs, and fasten up the
back of a blouse.”</p>

<p>“<i>Owen!</i>” exclaimed his sister, “<i>I</i> am present!”</p>

<p>“It was only Mrs. Hogben; she had no woman in
the house, and Tom’s hands were generally dirty, and
she said she looked upon me as her other son. She is
a rare good old soul, and I’d do more for her than that.”</p>

<p>“You must feel as if you’d been underground, and
come up for a breather,” said his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“My breather must be short; but I’m not going
to take any situation with ladies.”</p>

<p>“Why so proud and particular? They won’t all
be Miss Parretts!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you women are so irregular, unpunctual, and
undecided—yes, and nervous. Even Miss Susan clawed
me by the arm when we took a sharp turn.”</p>

<p>“I hope the next year will fly,” said Sir Martin;
“I tried my hand on your uncle, you know—did Leila
tell you? I have got him to make it eighteen months
hard labour—and eighteen months it is.”</p>

<p>“No! I say—that is splendid news! How awfully
good of you!”</p>

<p>“I fancy he’s a little bit indulgent now; he finds
that you can stick it, and have brought such a magnificent
character.”</p>

<p>“Profound regrets,” supplemented Leila, “if not
tears. Ah, here is dinner! I don’t suppose you’ve
<i>dined</i> since you were here in April; come along, Owen,
we are quite alone, and let us drink your health.”</p>

<p>Two days later Wynyard saw his sister and her
husband off from Euston by the White Star Express,
and felt that his holiday—his breathing time, was over.
He must get into harness at once. His one hope, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
he wandered about the streets, was that he might catch
sight of Aurea. By all accounts, she was staying in
Eaton Place; more than once he walked over there, and
strolled up and down on the opposite side, and gazed
at No. 303 as if he would see through the walls. But
it was no use—telepathy sometimes fails; Aurea never
appeared, and, had she done so—though he was not
aware of the sad fact—she would not have vouchsafed
the smallest notice of her aunts’ former employé.</p>

<p>The daily post brought several replies to Owen’s
advertisements. When he had looked through and
sorted them, he found that, after all, the most tempting
was from a woman—a certain Mrs. Cavendish Foote,
whose address was Rockingham Mansions, S.W.</p>

<p>The lady announced that she required a really smart,
experienced chauffeur for town—she had a new Renault
car; he would have to live out, and she offered him
four guineas a week, and to find himself in clothes and
minor repairs. She wrote from Manchester. He replied,
forwarding his references, and she engaged him by
telegram, saying she would be back in London the
following day, when he was to enter her service, and
call to interview her.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that this was good enough! He
would rather like a job in town for a change—the
more particularly as Aurea and her father were staying
with General Morven in Eaton Place, and now and
then he might obtain a glimpse of her! He glanced
through the other letters before finally making up
his mind; one was from a nobleman in the north
of Scotland, who lived thirty miles from a railway
station. He thought of the bitter Scotch winters, and
how he would be cut off from all society but that
of the servants’ hall; no, that was no good. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
was from a lady who was going on tour to the south of
France and Italy. The terms she offered were low,
and she preferred as chauffeur, a married man. There
were several others, but on the whole the situation in
London seemed to be the best. He debated as to
whether he should put on his chauffeur clothes or
not, but decided against it, and, hailing a taxi-cab,
found himself at Rockingham Mansions in ten
minutes.</p>

<p>These were a fine set of flats, with carpeted stairs,
imposing hall, and gorgeously liveried attendants. He
asked to be shown to Mrs. Cavendish Foote’s address.
It was No. 20 on the third floor. The door was opened
by a smart maid with a very small cap, an immensely
frizzled head, and sallow cheeks.</p>

<p>“To see Mrs. Cavendish Foote on business?” she
repeated, and ushered him into the tiny hall, which
was decorated with a curious assortment of pictures,
stuffed heads, arms, and looking-glasses.</p>

<p>“Oh, bring him in here,” commanded a shrill treble
voice, and Wynyard found himself entering a large
sitting-room, where he was saluted by an overwhelming
perfume of scent, and the angry barking of a tiny black
Pom. with a pink bow in his hair.</p>

<p>The apartment had been recently decorated; the prevailing
colours were white and pink—white walls, into
which large mirrors had been introduced—pink curtains,
pink carpets, pink and white chintz. Two or three half-dead
bouquets stood in vases, an opera cloak and a
feather boa encumbered one chair, a motor coat another,
several papers and letters were strewn upon the floor,
and on a long lounge under the windows, a lady—white
and pink to match her room—lay extended at full length,
her shapely legs crossed, and a cigarette in her mouth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
She wore a loose pink <i>negligé</i>—the wide sleeves exhibiting
her arms bare to the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” she exclaimed, when she caught sight of
Wynyard, as he emerged from behind the screen.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cavendish Foote, I presume?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Right-o!” she answered, suddenly assuming a
sitting posture; “and who may <i>you</i> be?”</p>

<p>“I’ve come about the situation as chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“The chauffeur!” she screamed. “Good Lord! why,
I’m blessed if you ain’t a toff!”</p>

<p>“Is that a drawback?” he asked gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, no—I suppose, rather an advantage! I
thought you were my manager, or I wouldn’t have let
you in,” and she pulled down her sleeves, and threw the
stump of her cigarette into the fireplace. “You see, though
I’m Mrs. Cavendish Foote, my professional name is Tottie
Toye. I dare say, you have seen me on the boards?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have had the pleasure,” he answered
politely.</p>

<p>“Oh my!” she ejaculated. “Well, anyhow, you’ve
got pretty manners. Can you drive?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I mean in London traffic. I don’t want to get
smashed up, you know; if I break a leg, where am I?
How long were you in your last place?”</p>

<p>“Six months.”</p>

<p>“And your reason for leaving?”</p>

<p>“They gave up keeping a motor.”</p>

<p>“<i>Idiots!</i>” she exclaimed. “I couldn’t live without
mine! Your job will be to take me to the shop, and
fetch me back at night, and to run me about London in
the daytime, and out into the country on Sundays—home
on Monday night. Do you think you can manage all
that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“The car is in the garage close to this. I dare say
you would like to take her out for a run and try her? I
shall want you this evening at seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re one of these gentlemen that have
come down in the world, and, of course, a chauffeur has
a ripping good time. I like your looks. By the way,
what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Owen.”</p>

<p>“And I suspect you are at this game, because you are
<i>owing</i> money—eh?” and she burst into a shriek of
laughter at her own joke. “Well, life has its ups and
downs! If it was all just flat, I should be bored stiff.
I’ve had some queer old turns myself.”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and a stout,
prosperous-looking gentleman made his appearance—red-faced,
blue-chinned, wonderfully got up, with shining
hair, and shining boots.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Tottie!” he exclaimed; “who have we got
here?” glancing suspiciously at Owen. “A new Johnny—eh—you
<i>naughty</i> girl?”</p>

<p>“No, no, dear old man,” she protested; “and do you
know, that you are twenty minutes late? so I have given
him your precious time. This”—waving her hand at
Owen—“is Mr. Cloake, my manager. Mr. Cloake, let
me present you to my new chauffeur.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>TOTTIE TOYE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tottie Toye’s</span> Renault was a beauty, and, after
the old rickety green car, it afforded Wynyard a real
pleasure to handle it. He took it for a trial turn to
Bushey, in order to get accustomed to its mechanism—for
every motor has its peculiar little ways and its own
little tempers—and punctually at seven o’clock he was
at Rockingham Mansions, awaiting his employer, the
dancer.</p>

<p>Presently, heralded by her high, shrill voice, she
appeared, accompanied by a melancholy young man, and
bringing with her such a reek of scent, that it almost
deadened the petrol. Tottie was wrapped in a magnificent
pink velvet cloak trimmed with ermine, and, as she
stepped into the car, turned to her companion and said—</p>

<p>“Teddy boy, just look at my beautiful new chauffeur!
Isn’t he like a young duke?”</p>

<p>Teddy grunted some inaudible reply, slammed the
door of the car with unnecessary violence, and they were
off. The London streets at this hour were swarming with
motor busses, cars, cabs, and carriages—people going to
dinners or the play. It was rather different to the empty
roads in the neighbourhood of Ottinge, but Wynyard
managed to thread his way to the theatre dexterously
and speedily, and, when the lady jumped out of the car
at the stage door, she clapped him on the back and said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“You’ll do all right! Come round for me again at
eleven—and don’t be getting into any mischief.”</p>

<p>He touched his cap and moved away. Precisely at
eleven o’clock he was waiting, and after some delay
Tottie reappeared, in a condition of the highest excitement,
screaming with laughter and carrying a gigantic
bouquet. She was accompanied by a very <i>prononcée</i>
lady and three young men. With a good deal of noisy
talking and chaffing they all packed themselves into the
car, sitting on one another’s knees, and fared to the
Savoy, where they had supper. Here again he waited
outside until twelve o’clock and closing time; and as
he sat, a motionless figure, a great deal of London life
drifted by him: the rolling “Limousine,” emblem of
luxury—broken-down, hopeless-looking men—members
of the dreadful army of the unemployed—flaming
women with the scarlet sign of sin in high relief. What
a diabolical existence!</p>

<p>At twelve his party reappeared—noisier and more
hilarious than ever. It struck him that Tottie’s lady
friend and two of the young men had had quite as much
supper as was good for them. Once more they crammed
into the car, the party returned to the flat to play bridge,
and he at last was released!</p>

<p>So this was now his life! late hours, excursions into
the country on Sundays, trips to Brighton, to Folkestone,
to Margate; he had no leisure, for, when Tottie was
not making use of the car, the good-natured little creature—unlike
Bella Parrett—lent it to her friends, and her
friends made unreasonable use of it. They were all
of the same class as herself: exuberant youths, who
imagined that they were seeing life; prettily painted,
beautifully dressed young women, whom the men called
by their christian names; certain elderly gentlemen; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
now and then a portly dame, who was spoken of as
“Ma.”</p>

<p>On one occasion, in Bond Street, Tottie and some of
her vivacious companions were shopping—a showy party,
with loud voices and louder clothes, scrambling into
the motor at the door of a shop—when who should pass
by but Sir Richard Wynyard! He glared at them,
then glanced at the chauffeur. <i>What!</i> his own nephew
in the middle of such a rowdy crew! Owen touched
his cap to him, but he vouchsafed no notice, and, with
a glassy stare, stalked on.</p>

<p>Another time, as Wynyard was waiting outside a
theatre, Aurea Morven and her uncle were coming out.
She looked so pretty—lovely, indeed—in a white cloak with
a knot of silver ribbon in her dark hair. Fortunately, she
did not recognise him, for at the moment Tottie dashed
out of the stage door in a violent hurry, followed by
two women and a man, and called authoritatively—</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Owen, old boy! The ‘Troc.’ as hard
as you can tear!”</p>

<p>Wynyard had been in the present situation for six
weeks, and, although the pay was good and punctual,
he found the life wearing. He never knew what it was
to have a day off—or any time to himself; other
employés had Sundays—Sunday to him was the heaviest
day in the whole week. Tottie, besides her professional
engagements, appeared to live in an irregular round of
luncheons, suppers, bridge, and balls—of a certain class.
She was madly extravagant, and seemed to take a
peculiar delight in throwing away her money. The
sallow-cheeked parlour-maid, who had a fancy for Wynyard,
and generally contrived to have a word with him
when she came downstairs with cloaks or shoes—informed
him in confidence that “the missus was a-goin’ it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“But what can you expect?” she asked, with her
nose in the air. “Her mother kept a tripe shop; she
ain’t no class! Of course the money’s good as long
as it’s there; but I don’t fancy these sort of fast
situations. Give <i>me</i> gentry.”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Foote’s all right,” protested Wynyard;
“it’s her friends that are such a queer lot—and, I’m
afraid, they cheat her.”</p>

<p>“You bet they do! And as to her being all right—I
should say she was all wrong, if you ask <i>me</i>. She’s
no more Mrs. Cavendish Foote than I am; she was
divorced three years ago. Cavendish Foote—he was a
young fool on the Stock Exchange; she broke him,
and now he’s gone to America.”</p>

<p>An exceedingly unpleasant idea had lately been born
in Owen’s mind; it was this—that his employer had
taken a fancy to <i>him</i>. She leant with unnecessary weight
on his arm when she stepped in and out of the motor;
summoned him to her sitting-room on various pretexts to
give him notes; offered cigarettes, talked to him confidentially,
and begged him “to look upon her as a friend.”</p>

<p>“I like you, Owen, I swear I do, and I’d do a lot
for you, so I would too—and don’t you make any
mistake about that!”</p>

<p>Wynyard found this state of affairs extremely embarrassing—especially
when they went for trips into the
country alone, and, wrapped up in furs, she would come
and sit beside him, and tell him of all her successes; stop
at inns, order lunch, and invite him to share the meal,
and drink champagne! But this he steadily declined.
The cooler and more reserved he was, naturally the more
<i>empressé</i> she became; and one of her pals, in his hearing,
had loudly chaffed her on being “<i>mashed on her chauffeur</i>.”</p>

<p>Once or twice, she found some one to mind the car,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
and gave him a ticket for the theatre, in order that
he might witness her performance. Tottie really was
marvellous; it was no wonder that she was earning
two hundred pounds a week! Her dancing, her agility,
her vivacity, and her impudence, enraptured each
nightly audience. There was something in her gaiety
and her unstudied animation that reminded him of
Aurea Morven; yet to think of the two in the same
moment was neither more or less than profanation—the
one was a sort of irresponsible imp, whilst the other
resembled a beautiful and benevolent fairy.</p>

<p>It was early in December, Tottie had run over to
Paris with Mr. Cloake and suitable pals, and Wynyard
had got his neck out of the collar for a few days. In fact,
he had insisted on a holiday, and treated himself to
a dinner at his club. Here he met some old friends—that
is to say, young men of his own age, who had been
at Eton, or in the Service with him. He always looked
well turned out, and none of them ever thought of asking
“What are you doing now?” except a schoolfellow,
who said—</p>

<p>“I say, old man, we don’t often see <i>you</i> here! What’s
your job? I know the uncle has cut up rusty, and that
you are on your own. Fellows say that you are down
in some big steel works at Sheffield, and they have seen
you out with the hounds.”</p>

<p>“No, they’re wrong—that’s a bad shot. I don’t
mind telling you, old pal, that I’m a <i>chauffeur</i>.”</p>

<p>His friend stared, and then burst out into a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m the chauffeur of the well-known Tottie
Toye.”</p>

<p>This information seemed to leave the other not only
solemn, but speechless—which being the case, Wynyard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
went on to impart to him in confidence all the particulars
of his uncle’s manifesto, and how he was endeavouring
to keep himself in independence, without as much as a
penny stamp from one of his relatives.</p>

<p>“I’ve done eight months,” he said, “and I’ve
saved thirty pounds. I seem to see the Winning Post.”</p>

<p>“By George!” exclaimed his friend, “I don’t know
how you can stick it. Fancy being mixed up with
Tottie and her crowd!”</p>

<p>“Oh, for that matter, I’ve nothing to say to them.
‘Needs must when the devil drives,’ and the pay is good.”</p>

<p>“I believe Tottie has a mania for spending money.
She has been twice married; her extravagance is crazy,
and her generosity boundless—of course, she is robbed
all round. Now she has got into the hands of a fellow
called Cloake—and unless I’m mistaken the end is near.
Get out of it as soon as you can, Wynyard, my friend.”</p>

<p>“I believe I shall. I can’t say it’s a job I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Look here, I’ve an idea. There’s a friend of mine—Masham—an
enormously rich chap, a bachelor, mad
keen about motoring—racing, you know. He was in
the Paris to Berlin race—and has been over to Long
Island—and on the slightest provocation would be off
to Timbuctoo! He’s looking for a man, not so much
to drive—but, of course, he must be a chauffeur—as to
go about with him—a gentleman. I should say it was
the very billet for you—<i>if</i> he doesn’t kill you! It’s
not every one’s job; he is so confoundedly rash, and is
always ready to take risks.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind that,” said Wynyard; “‘nothing
venture—nothing have.’”</p>

<p>“He wants a smart chap—a well-bred ’un—with
no nerves. Shall I undertake the delicate negotiation?
I expect you’d suit him down to the ground!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>MASHAM—THE MOTORIST</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I’ll</span> go over and have a jaw with him; you stay here
till I come back,” said Wynyard’s friend, rising as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, he appeared accompanied by
a clean-shaven, bullet-headed little man—with a brick-coloured
complexion, sleek black hair, a pair of small,
piercing grey eyes, and the shoulders of a Hercules.</p>

<p>“Wynyard, let me introduce you to Masham, the
celebrated motorist. Masham, this is my old chum
Wynyard; we were in the same house at Eton. He
is in want of a job—you are in want of a chauffeur—and
here you are!” Then, with a wave of his hand,
he added, “Now, I’ll leave you to worry it out between
you. You will find me in the card-room,” and he took
his departure.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Masham, throwing himself back in
an arm-chair, and stretching out his legs, “our mutual
friend has been telling me all about you, and how you
are an Army chap, awfully sportin’, and have no nerves
to speak of.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shouldn’t call myself—er—nervous,” said
Wynyard, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>“I suppose Eustace has told you that I’m motor
mad? Motoring is my fad. I expect I’ve put in more
miles than any man of my age in England. On these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
long journeys I like to have a pal who can drive a bit,
is a gentleman, and has got his head screwed on the
right way. By the bye, are you a married man?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Good! That’s all right. Well, the ordinary
chauffeur palls a bit after a time, and you can’t well
have him to dine with you—and—er—in fact—he’s not
your <i>own</i> sort! On the other hand, there are one’s
relatives and chums; but some of these—and I’ve sampled
a good few—know nothing of the mechanism of a car—racer
and runabout, it’s all one to <i>them</i>—and they bar
going with me. I put them in a first-class blue funk
when my speed is eighty miles an hour, and hats and
things fly out of the car. Of course, it’s not always
possible; but sometimes in the very early mornings
on those long flat roads in France I let her out! I
tell you, it’s an experience. However, the last time
when I got her up to ninety kilometres, at the first halt,
my chauffeur got off and left me! I’m not a bad sort
to deal with, as old Eustace can tell you; you just let
me alone, and you’ll be all right. You live with me—same
quarters, same table—and your billet will be that
of chauffeur-companion—<i>compagnon de voyage</i>—with an
eye to the car and to take the wheel now and then.
If you can talk French it will be an advantage; but I
don’t suppose you picked up much French at Eton?”</p>

<p>“I picked it up when I was a small boy. I had a
French nurse,” replied Wynyard, “and I can get along
all right.”</p>

<p>“Good! My idea is to motor down to Biarritz,
then across to Marseilles, and afterwards, with a look in
at Monte, take part in some international racing. Who
were you with last, or who are you with now?”</p>

<p>“Just at present I’m chauffeur to Tottie Toye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“My great aunt!”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, when she engaged me from an
advertisement, she represented herself as Mrs. Cavendish
Foote—the terms were liberal, and I agreed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and when you saw her?” His little eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>“I must confess I was rather taken aback; theatrical
folk are not much in my line—irregular hours and
sudden odd jobs—sometimes I’ve been out with the car
till three in the morning. However, it was a question
of money, and I took it.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what she pays you?”</p>

<p>“Four guineas a week.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go one better than that. I’ll give you three
hundred a year—twenty-five pounds a month, and all
found; but, mark you, you had better insure your life,
for I’ve had some uncommonly narrow squeaks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the risk,” said Wynyard. “Would you
mind telling me what is <i>your</i> idea of a narrow squeak?”</p>

<p>“Well, once crossing a railway line an express
missed me by twenty seconds; another was when the
car ran backwards down a pass in the Tyrol, and over
the bridge at the bottom; that time the chauffeur was
killed. I’m keeping his family, of course—and henceforth
I bar married men! I broke three ribs and a leg;
however, we won’t dwell on these unpleasant memories.
Do you think you will be ready to start in a week?
The car is down at Coventry. I’ll fetch her up day after
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I shall be ready; but I have one stipulation to
make.”</p>

<p>“All right—let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“As a chauffeur my name is Owen—not Wynyard.”</p>

<p>“Same thing to me. Uncle objects, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“I suppose Miss Toye will accept a week’s notice?”</p>

<p>“Of course she will,” declared Masham. “We will
have a day or two at Brookwood, to see how the car
travels, and then cross the Channel. Have a drink?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, a small whisky and large soda.”</p>

<p>Mr. Masham ordered for himself a large whisky and
a very small soda; indeed, the soda water in his glass
was a negligible quantity.</p>

<p>“I don’t drink much—but I take it strong,” he
remarked as he gulped it down, “and I never smoke—bad
for the nerves;” and then he began to discourse of
motors and the class and style he believed in. He
believed in single-cylinder machines, a short wheel base,
wide handle-bars, and a large petrol tank. He did not
believe in the aeroplane craze, and, indeed, became both
hot and excited when Wynyard introduced the subject.</p>

<p>“Madness! Wild goose business! Can come to
nothing—look at the accidents! Stick to Mother Earth,
<i>I</i> say! I’m an earth man—a motor man. The sea
for fish, the sky for birds, earth for humans. I bar
both air and sea.”</p>

<p>After a few minor arrangements, Wynyard took
leave of Mr. Masham, went in search of his friend, and
informed him that all was fixed up; he had accepted
the post of companion-chauffeur to the celebrated Harry
Masham, and was about to tender his resignation to the
equally celebrated Tottie Toye.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>During Lady Kesters’ stay in the United States, she
had kept up a brisk correspondence with her brother,
and written long and enthusiastic descriptions of her
impressions of New York, Washington, and Boston;
for his part, he had sent her somewhat scanty news.
The following, is one of his longest letters:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“<span class="smcap">Dear Leila</span>,—I am still with Miss T. Toye, and
giving (I hope) satisfaction and saving hand over fist.
I can’t say, however, that the berth is congenial. I am
kept pretty busy, taking Tottie to the theatre, fetching
her home, motoring her about town to shops and
restaurants, and dashing into the country for weekends.
In Town, I wear my goggles as much as possible.
I tell her my eyes are weak—I dare say she doesn’t
believe me! I’m not proud, but I don’t want my old
friends to spot me as Tottie’s chauffeur. The other
day I was in Bond Street in the afternoon, with a car
full of a noisy painted crew, and they attracted the
attention of no less a person than <i>Uncle Dick</i>. He
stared at them, and then at me. I thought he was
going to have an apoplectic seizure, and I’m sure he
thinks I’ve gone to the devil! Perhaps you’d let him
know that I’ve got to live, and Tottie pays well, and
her money is as good as another’s. All the same, I
am not sure that I can stand her much longer; she and
her particular lot are a bit too rowdy. The other night
a fellow dared her to kiss me as she got out of the motor,
and, by Jove! she <i>did</i>. I was not at all grateful. I was
nearly stifled, and I’ve not got the better of her scented
embrace yet. She talks of buying another car—price
fifteen hundred pounds—simply because Vixie Beaufort
has a better one than hers, and she’s not going to be
beat. She has a funny way of asking all sorts of people
to supper, and is surprised when the crowd turns up;
and sometimes she forgets her party altogether, and
sups out, then the boot is on the other foot! She
plays bridge of a sort, and loses her money (and her
temper), and throws the cards at her partner. The
frizzy parlour-maid is my informant; she comes down
with cloaks and furs, and generally contrives to have
a word with me. She says the place is getting too hot,
and if I will leave, <i>she</i> will! Think of that! I’m glad to
hear such good news of Martin. I expect you will both
be home by April, and by that time I should not wonder
if I were in another situation. Ryder Street will always
find—Your affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="right">“O. W.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>To this he received a long reply from Florida.
Martin was better, shares were booming, and The Palm
Branch was the most delicious spot on earth. No
wonder that Florida boasted the largest hotel in the
world; the climate, the tropical flowers and fruit, the
bicycling and bathing, and the immense variety of
visitors were all a delightful novelty.</p>

<p>She went on to say—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do wish you were with us; there are such
charming girls to be met and known—bright, well-bred,
intellectual, and fascinating. I am in love with several
of them myself. I hope we shall be back in Mount
Street at the end of April; meanwhile we are sunning
ourselves here. Take my advice, and give the vivacious
Tottie notice, and try for nice country place with some
wealthy old squire who is not <i>exigeant</i> with respect
to work, and would only require to be motored to the
Sessions or to church; in such a place, you can lie perdue
instead of flaring about town with Tottie and Co. I
would be perfectly happy if you were here, dear old boy;
the only drawback to my enjoyment is the fear that you
are hard worked, and hard up! Bear this in mind,
‘Time and tide run through the longest day;’ in ten
months you will be settled at Wynyard, and your <i>own</i>
master.”</p>
</div>

<p>As it happened, there was no occasion for Wynyard
to formally tender his resignation to Miss Toye. The
morning after his interview with Mr. Masham, when
he arrived at the garage where the car was kept, another
chauffeur came up to him with a sympathetic grin upon
his face.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Jack—your car is took! There’s an
execution in your missus’ flat, and the men came
round ’ere first thing. Very nippy, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are talking about,” rejoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Wynyard. He walked over to the place where
the car was always garaged, and it was empty; everything
was gone—even to the oil cans!</p>

<p>“There, now, you see it’s a true bill,” said the other
man, who had followed him. “Tottie Toye is broke;
there was a great burst-up at the theatre, and she has
cut it.”</p>

<p>This was true. Wynyard now remembered that the
last time he had driven Tottie from the hall there had
been something of a scene at the stage door—loud
talking, an eager crowd, and Mr. Cloake, very red and
excited, had supported Tottie into the motor, apparently
in hysterics and tears. He went round to the flat, and
discovered that men were already in possession, busily
making an inventory of its contents. Tottie had
effected her escape with all her jewels, her best clothes,
and her dog, and was reported to be at San Sebastian.</p>

<p>It seemed to Wynyard that something was bound
to happen to whoever employed him—one time it was
a breakdown, now the bailiffs.</p>

<p>Before he and his new employer went abroad, they
spent several days at Brookwood, and here the new
chauffeur was first introduced to the machine—a long,
bare, business-looking car, built for speed, not comfort,
and painted a dull slate colour.</p>

<p>“She’s as ugly as she can stick!” admitted her
owner; “but she runs sweetly and is a magnificent
machine; has won three big races, a grand goer, and
ab-so-lutely reliable!”</p>

<p>Flying round the track at Brookwood she certainly
bore out her reputation for speed; but as to whether
she was absolutely reliable, remained to be proved.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>TAKING RISKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in January Wynyard found himself on the
Continent, roaming hither and thither as dictated by the
caprice of his employer. First they went to Paris, then,
leaving behind them the intricacies of the traffic, departed
from that gay city by the Port de Choisy for
Mellun, Sens, and Dijon. From Dijon (the Charing
Cross of motors) they sped across to Biarritz, over the
Pyrenees to Madrid, then back to the Riviera, <i>via</i>
Carcassonne and Toulouse.</p>

<p>It was Masham’s custom to start at daybreak;
the car was on the wing as soon as the birds. They
swept along the great straight highways, by quiet
sleeping farms, through low-hanging mists, and now and
then past an old white-faced château, staring sternly from
amidst its woods—or again, a gaudy red villa smothered
in lime trees. Masham had not overstated the case when
he declared that he “took risks.” Once or twice, when
they hummed along wide, empty roads, as the wind
roared past their ears, and the engine vibration was such
that every nerve was ajar, it appeared to the chauffeur
that he was trusting his life to a madman! <i>Speed</i>, his
employer’s passion, seemed to grow insatiable with time—his
appetite for eating up, with furious haste, miles
and miles and miles, and ever hurrying onwards to the
unattainable horizon, increased with indulgence. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
intoxication of motion appeared to lift him completely
out of himself—and to change his personality.</p>

<p>Wynyard had once quoted to his friend, “Needs must
when the devil drives!” Now at times he could readily
believe that the old gentleman himself was holding the
steering-wheel!</p>

<p>Sometimes, as they tore through villages, they left a
track of whirling feathers—the remains of a flock of
geese or poultry; and Masham boasted, to his chauffeur’s
disgust, that once, between Pau and Biarritz, he and
his machine had been the death of five dogs. On more
than one occasion, when his excitement was frenzied, and
he undoubtedly saw <i>red</i>, Wynyard had endeavoured to
wrest the steering-wheel from his employer. They had
several narrow escapes, and many of their skids were
neither more nor less than hair-raising. Wynyard’s face,
which was tanned and weather-beaten, displayed several
new lines, and sometimes wore a very grim expression,
as the car whirled round a sharp corner with a single
and defiant hoot! But these risks were his price; it
was all in the day’s work, for three hundred a year.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that he was unable to find a
commonplace situation, which offered the happy medium;
either he drove an old doddering car at infrequent
intervals, or he was bound to this grey racer, like Ixion
to his wheel.</p>

<p>Excepting on the occasions when Masham was
specially reckless, the situation was all right. They lived
at the best hotels, and he sat at the same table with his
employer—whose talk was ever and always of the car,
or other people’s cars—of petrol, garages, tyres, and
racing. He was a man of one idea.</p>

<p>His companion-chauffeur was a good deal staggered
by the large quantity of cognac absorbed by his patron;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
but it never appeared to affect his nerves, and merely
rendered him unsociable and morose. His one, all-devouring
ambition was to win a race for the highest
speed, and to be known as the most daring and successful
motorist in Europe! When they stopped at hotels he
herded with his kind—after the manner of golfers and
racing people—comparing cars, speeds, weights, and
prices, talking knowingly of “mushroom valves” and
the “new sliding sleeve engine.” On such occasions,
instead of being, as usual, somewhat stolid and glum, he
became extraordinarily animated and eloquent!</p>

<p>Masham was a man of good family, his own master,
and the non-resident owner of a fine property in the
north of England, which, in order to indulge his passion
for speed, he neglected shamefully.</p>

<p>Arrived at Nice, he put up at one of the fashionable
hotels, running over daily to Monte Carlo, which, in the
month of March, was crammed. On these expeditions,
he was accompanied by his companion, and the car was
garaged, whilst its owner took what he called “a turn in
the rooms.” He played for high stakes, generally put
down a <i>mille</i> note, and was uncannily lucky. This good
fortune he attributed to the little silver figure of a certain
saint, which he clutched in one hand, whilst he staked
with the other; this saint was his mascot. He never
remained long in the Casino, being too impatient and
restless; and when he had made a round of his favourite
tables, would sally forth in search of refreshment, or to
saunter about the square and the exquisite gardens.
His companion did not gamble—strong as were inherited
instincts, and hot as was the gambling fever which ran in
his blood;—he had no money to lose, and the prize he
wished to win was Aurea Morven.</p>

<p>Naturally, Masham came across many acquaintances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
in such a cosmopolitan rendezvous as “Monte.”
Wynyard also encountered several familiar faces, and,
one afternoon, as he was passing through a great crowd
at the “Café de Paris,” a light hand was laid on his
arm, and, looking down, he was astonished to meet the
upturned blue eyes of Mrs. Ramsay—Mrs. Ramsay in
black, but no longer in weeds; Mrs. Ramsay another
woman, and ten years younger; Mrs. Ramsay self-confident,
prosperous, and handsome.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s <i>Owen</i>!” she exclaimed. “Who would
have thought of seeing you here?”</p>

<p>He smiled affirmatively, and glanced at her companions
round the tea-table. Ottinge was strongly
represented: here were the Rector and Miss Aurea, also
General and Mrs. Morven, and a smart young man in
attendance on the younger lady.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Owen!” exclaimed Mr. Morven, rising and
shaking hands; “this <i>is</i> an unexpected meeting!” and
he stared with puzzled interest at the erect figure, high-bred
face, unimpeachable grey suit, and Homburg hat.</p>

<p>“I’m not over here to gamble,” he continued. “We
are at Mentone, and I’ve come to have a look at this
pretty, wicked place.”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty wicked by all accounts!” replied
Wynyard, speaking now, as Mr. Morven noted, in the
tone of equal to equal.</p>

<p>“Aurea,” he said, turning to his daughter, “don’t
you see Owen?”</p>

<p>Miss Morven—who had entirely regained her beauty,
and was charmingly dressed—glanced up from underneath
her immense rose-wreathed hat, and coolly surveyed
her former lover. She was, if possible, prettier
than ever, he said to himself, as he doffed his hat in
acknowledgment of her curt nod; but her eyes, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
met his, resembled two dark pools—frozen. For some
unknown and unguessed-at reason, Aurea was no longer
friendly to him—much less anything nearer—and the
discovery seemed to plant a dagger in his throat. He
found it desperately difficult to utter a word, much less
to carry on a brisk conversation with the Rector and
Mrs. Ramsay. General and Mrs. Morven were, he concluded,
the important elderly couple who sat at the other
side of the table, and the young man, who was engrossing
Miss Morven’s sole attention, was some idle ass, who
wore his hair parted in the middle, and three rings on
his left hand. He hated him then and there!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Miss Morven encouraged him, and kept
up a conversation in low, confidential tones. Her hat
concealed her face, and Wynyard realised, for the first
time in his life, how rude a hat could be! This black
hat, garlanded with pink flowers, was but too eloquently
expressive of the fact, that its wearer desired to ignore
the existence—much less the presence—of her aunts’
late employé.</p>

<p>However, the Rector and Mrs. Ramsay were most
anxiously disposed to make amends for Miss Morven’s
detachment.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the gardens?” inquired the
former, indicating the flower-beds that lay between
them and the Casino—a blaze of velvet violas. “Quite
in your line, eh?”</p>

<p>Wynyard muttered an inarticulate assent—all his
thoughts were concentrated on Aurea.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you are getting on,” resumed the
Rector cheerily; “prospects improving, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered the chauffeur; his mind
full of this gentleman’s only daughter, and the haughty
little face which was so studiously concealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“What are you doing now, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’m with Masham, a man who has a racing motor,
as useful companion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by Jove, I know him!” broke in the General.
“Masham’s the wildest driver in England, or, indeed,
Europe—a racing lunatic—wish you safely out of his
company! Is he here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the rooms; and I’m just loafing about till
he is ready to go back to Nice.”</p>

<p>“You have never asked about poor dear little
Ottinge,” interposed Mrs. Ramsay, with an injured
air,—Mrs. Ramsay who had hitherto been a silent and
much interested spectator of Wynyard and Aurea.
What <i>was</i> the matter with the girl?</p>

<p>“And how is Ottinge?” he inquired, turning to the
Rector.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty well, thank you. Young Hogben is
married to Dilly Topham. I must say I never thought
<i>that</i> would come off, but it has; and they seem fairly
happy. Old Mrs. Topham, however, gave no dowry;
she cannot bear to part with a penny, but she sent a
present of three jars of mouldy jam, and a broken-down
lamp.”</p>

<p>“Miss Parrett has been dangerously ill,” supplemented
Mrs. Ramsay, “but is better. Old Thunder has bought
a donkey and a bath-chair; and oh, sad news indeed!—how
<i>am</i> I to tell you?—Mackenzie is no more.”</p>

<p>“I can bear up,” he answered, with a short laugh.
This was ungrateful, for was it not Mackenzie who had
introduced him to Aurea?</p>

<p>“He was kicked by a horse, and was killed on the
spot,” said the Rector; “I think, Mrs. Ramsay, you show
a very unneighbourly spirit.”</p>

<p>“But I never considered myself the neighbour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
Mackenzie!” she argued, “just the opposite—and he
was not an estimable character. A good man should not
own a bad dog.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, give a dog a bad name——”</p>

<p>“And Mackenzie deserved it,” she interrupted; “he
was the village bully. If he met a smaller dog, it was
death for the small dog; if one of his own size, he passed
on. You know, or you may not know, that, at teas at
the Rectory, he sat on the laps of timid ladies, devoured
their offerings, and intimidated them with growls—they
dared not displace him.” Then, turning her head,
“Aurea, we are talking of Mackenzie and his enormities.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you?” she rejoined, with civil indifference.</p>

<p>“Yes,” resumed Mrs. Ramsay; “and is not it well
known that he attacked a solitary visitor in the Rectory
drawing-room—whose furs affronted him—and tore her
muff to shreds with ferocious satisfaction? I believe
her screams could be heard at the Drum, and she had to
be restored with brandy and burnt feathers.”</p>

<p>“You would delight Dr. Johnson, my dear lady,”
said the Parson; “he loved a good hater.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you only knew how he treated and maltreated
my poor paying guests,”—and she looked at Wynyard—“<i>you</i>
remember the beagle, and how you doctored him;
only for you he would have died.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the beagle survives—Mackenzie is no
more. <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i>”</p>

<p>To hear this chauffeur with a ready Latin quotation
in his mouth! What was the world coming to? thought
Mrs. Morven, who had finished her tea, and was now
playing the part of a dignified audience.</p>

<p>“We are all at the Hôtel des Montaignes, Mentone,”
continued Mrs. Ramsay; “I want you to come over and
see me, will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“I should be delighted, but my time is not my own—perhaps
I can get off on Sunday. May I write?”</p>

<p>“Do; and I shall expect to hear that you are coming
to lunch.”</p>

<p>“Here is Masham,” he announced, as the muscular,
brick-faced gentleman pushed and elbowed his way
towards them.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Owen, ready to start, eh? We must get a
move on.”—“Oh,” to the General, “glad to see you—splendid
weather out here, eh?”</p>

<p>At this moment a party of compatriots arrived, and
figuratively swallowed up General and Mrs. Morven, the
Rector, Mrs. Ramsay, and even the celebrated Mr.
Masham. Here was Wynyard’s opportunity, and, as
usual, he seized upon it without ceremony. It was impossible
that Aurea (who was rarely out of his thoughts),
whose little word, “perhaps,” had buoyed him up on
many stormy waters, meant what her looks and attitude
implied. Resolutely he came up to her, ignoring the
glassy stare of her companion, and said—</p>

<p>“Miss Morven—has forgotten me—<i>perhaps</i>?”</p>

<p>Miss Morven looked up at him with an expression of
delicate disdain. Could this self-possessed young lady,
in a wonderful hat and Parisian frock, be the self-same
girl who had stood beside him on Yampton Hill, with
loosened hair and spattered habit?</p>

<p>After a reflective pause, she murmured—</p>

<p>“No, I’ve not forgotten my aunts’—er—chauffeur;
but I do not think we were ever—<i>acquainted</i>.”</p>

<p>Wynyard had wonderful self-command, but mentally
he reeled; he felt as if some one had suddenly dealt him
a terrible blow between the eyes. Outwardly he turned
a sudden, pallid white, and drew back, as Miss Morven
rose, picked up her parasol, and said to her companion—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“<i>Now</i>, if you like, I will go down to the Condamine
and see the motor boats.”</p>

<p>And, almost at the same moment, Mr. Masham claimed
his companion and hurried him away to the garage.</p>

<p>“I say,” said the General to his brother (he usually
prefaced his remarks with “I say”), “who was the
young stranger who seemed to know Ottinge? ’Pon
my word, he deserves a medal for the discovery. Wait,
I seem to know his face! Yes, I’ve got it. Wynyard
of the Red Hussars—he went the pace—uncle cut up
rough—he’s in my club.”</p>

<p>“No, for once you are a bit out! You will be
amused to hear that that good-looking, well-set-up
young man was Bella’s chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“It’s a sober fact. I liked him,” continued the
Rector; “he has good manners—manners make the
man—I had him in the choir, and he’s a first-class
cricketer. I always, between you and me, believed
him to be a gentleman who was expiating some—er—mistake.
I declare, Susan was actually fond of him,
and he turned the heads, unintentionally—I’ll say that
for him—of every girl in the village.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blowed! He is the very image of Dick
Wynyard’s heir—next to the baronetcy and property.
Old Dick never speaks of him now, and I’ve not seen
him about for nearly two years. Mrs. Ramsay, what do
you say to a village romance, and a chauffeur being
as like a young swell as two peas?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied the lady, deliberately moulding on her
gloves, “truth is stranger than fiction; I’ve known
some funny things in my life. I always liked Owen,
and I am glad to see he is getting up in the world.”</p>

<p>“Up!” repeated the General; “if he is companion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Masham, he is much more likely to leave the world
altogether—and that at an early date! Well, Edgar,
Aurea has gone off with young Beauclerc and his people
to the boats. Shall we go to La Turbie as arranged,
and have the honour of escorting the two ladies?”</p>

<p>And then, with one consent, they rose with a loud
noise of scraping chairs, and passed into the square
in single file.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br>

<small>AN EXPLANATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ramsay’s</span> trip to the Sunny South was accounted
for by the fact that she had recently come into possession
of a comfortable fortune, left to her by her godfather
“in recognition and admiration,” said the will, “of
the noble way in which Kathleen Ramsay had carried
out her marriage vow—for better or worse.”</p>

<p>The widow had gladly accepted an invitation, and
joined the Morven party. She was extremely fond of
Aurea, the girl’s sunny nature and light-heartedness
was a grateful tonic for her own sad frame of mind;
but she now felt deeply indignant with her friend for
her treatment of Mr. Wynyard, and could not have
believed her capable of such snobbishness, had she not
witnessed it with her own eyes. She had noticed his
hurried address, Aurea’s quick reply, and then his
face. <i>What</i> had the girl said, to thus turn him into
stone? Personally, she liked Owen immensely! was
deeply in his debt, and ready to forward his happiness
and his interests to the best of her ability. Kathleen
Ramsay, a woman of warm feelings and responsive
susceptibilities, would have been delighted to promote
a love-match between Owen Wynyard and Aurea Morven.</p>

<p>Aurea’s unexpected attitude had filled her with
amazement and rage; she could hardly restrain herself,
but managed to hold her peace—and that with pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
and grief—for four whole days; at the end of the time,
she received a letter from Aurea’s lover, which caused
her restraint to break all bonds:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Ramsay</span>,—I find it will be impossible
for me to go over and see you, as we are leaving for Milan
to-morrow. I should have liked to have had a long talk
with you—you and I have few secrets from one another—but,
as the Rector and Miss Morven are in your hotel, I
could not have faced them again, and given Miss Morven
the trouble of cutting me for a second time. You suspected
me, I know, and I may tell you that it was Aurea Morven
who kept me in Ottinge for six months; that, chiefly
for her sake, I took on a detestable job in Town, and
engaged to risk my neck with this crazy motorist;
for every week that I was earning my bread and keeping
my promise, was bringing me, I believed, nearer to <i>her</i>.
To the best of my knowledge I have never given her any
reason to think ill of me; on the contrary, I have striven
tremendously hard to make myself more worthy of
her, and the other day, when I met her accidentally, I
thought it was a wonderful piece of good luck for me;
instead of which, it was the blackest day I’ve ever
known. She refused to remember or recognise me.
I have only six months more to work off—sometimes I
think I’ll chuck the whole thing and enlist; I would,
only for my sister. What’s the good of trying? I’m
afraid this is a beastly sort of letter, but....”</p>
</div>

<p>Some words were scratched out, but read, very
carefully, and held up to the light, they were faintly
decipherable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I sometimes feel as if I were going mad—I don’t
care now if we have some bad accident. I only hope
it will kill me.—Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Owen Wynyard</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was the Honourable Mrs. Ramsay, daughter of
the late, and sister of the present, Viscount Ballingarry—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
not Katie—who, that evening, entered Aurea’s
bedroom immediately after a knock. She discovered
her young victim in a charming white <i>negligé</i> and a
rose silk petticoat, engaged in brushing her magnificent
hair. There was war in the visitor’s face as she seated
herself, and, after a moment’s expressive silence, fired
her first gun.</p>

<p>“Aurea, I want you to tell me why you were so
amazingly, so cruelly, rude to Owen, your aunts’
chauffeur?”</p>

<p>Miss Aurea, after a glance at her friend, coolly
replied—</p>

<p>“Why should <i>I</i> be called upon to do the polite to
my aunts’ <i>ci-devant</i> employé?”</p>

<p>“Aurea! This is not you—there must be some
crooked turn in you, or there’s some other detestable
girl in your body!”</p>

<p>“It is Aurea Morven, I assure you,” and she drew
herself together with a quick movement; “and I do not
wish to hear anything of Owen, the chauffeur. <i>I</i> know
more about him than you suppose.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know a quarter as much as I do!” retorted
Mrs. Ramsay with decision, and her eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>“I know that he was on a ranch in South America,
that he was a waiter on the <i>Anaconda</i>——”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, go on.”</p>

<p>“That he was probably in the Army, that he is in
disgrace with his family, and came to hide himself in
Ottinge till the storm, whatever it was, blew over! and
that a tall dark lady came to meet him at Brodfield,
and even at the Drum.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” inquired Mrs. Ramsay.</p>

<p>“I saw her—I saw him kissing a woman at the
Drum as I passed; all Ottinge might have done the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
same! Their shadows were on the blind. I saw him
and the woman drive away; they passed me in a motor,
he, leaning back delightfully at his ease, and she bending
over him as if she adored him! And this is not second-hand
news, for I witnessed it myself.”</p>

<p>“Why should you be so furious, Aurea? Aurea,
<i>I</i> know why!” and her tone was vibrating and sarcastic.</p>

<p>The girl turned upon her with flashing eyes; but,
before she could speak, Mrs. Ramsay said—</p>

<p>“You say your news is first-hand—so is mine; I
promised to keep Mr. Wynyard’s secret.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I knew his name was Wynyard,” interrupted
Aurea.</p>

<p>“Of course—my poor old man uttered it with his
last breath. He was fond of Owen; he mistook him for
his friend and schoolfellow—Owen’s father—and Owen
allowed him to think so. I pledged myself to silence,
but even <i>he</i> would permit me to break it now. The lady
who came to see Owen, and who has so excited your
wrath, was”—speaking very deliberately—“his sister,
Lady Kesters.”</p>

<p>Aurea’s tortoiseshell brush fell to the floor with a
resounding clang. Then, in a very few words, Mrs.
Ramsay—impulsive, eloquent, and Irish—laid the whole
story of Sir Richard’s bargain before the girl, who stood
listening as if in a dream.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wynyard was so good to my poor husband,
and, indeed, to me, I’ll never, never forget it. And, you
see, Jimmy knew his father and mother, whom he could
not remember, and one night in the dusk, just before
I left, he told me his whole story. Of course I had
always known he was the son of Captain Wynyard,
and that he himself had been in the Red Hussars, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
I did <i>not</i> know why he was earning his bread as
your aunts’ chauffeur! He never said a word of you,
but I understood—I realised the attraction that kept
him, a young man of the world, in out-of-the-way Ottinge.
He opened his heart to me that August night, and
now, Aurea, you have broken it.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“Don’t pretend,” she cried passionately, and she
looked at her almost threateningly; “don’t add to your
sins. <i>You</i> know as well as I do how you treated him—certainly
not as a lady should do; why, if I were to
meet one of the Brodfield fly-drivers here I’d give him
a civil greeting. You were outrageously rude—you
overdid it. My only comfort is that, to be so jealous,
you must have been extremely fond of him.”</p>

<p>Aurea coloured—she could blush furiously—and her
complexion was very pink indeed, as seen through long
strands of hair.</p>

<p>Then she sat down rather suddenly, and said—</p>

<p>“What’s done is done—and never can be undone!”
and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Honourable Mrs. Ramsay, having
said her say, and “rubbed it in” remorselessly, quietly
effected her departure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br>

<small>SITUATION THE FOURTH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was evident that some kind of armistice or <i>pourparlers</i>
had been arranged between Mrs. Ramsay and
her misguided young companion, for, when the General,
the Rector, and Mrs. Morven returned to England, home,
and duty, these ladies still remained abroad, and went
together to a small and picturesque village in the very
heart of the Alpes-Maritimes. Aurea longed for some such
quiet retreat, where she could hide herself, and recover
from a blow which had still left its quivering traces.
Love and happiness were possibly within her reach, and
she had, in all ignorance, cast them aside; her widowed
chaperone understood and sympathised, and, though it
was she who had inflicted the wound, she was absolved.</p>

<p>In the inn of a little mountain village the friends
spent three weeks far from the giddy crowds, aloof from
luxury, and the world. Here were thick cups, thin
candles, good coffee, and sour bread. What long walks
and talks they enjoyed, and how fully the girl opened
her innocent heart to the experienced, world-worn
matron! Letters were rare, and newspapers ignored;
in Aurea’s mental condition, what were to her the fate
of plays, of Cabinets, yea, of nations? She was never
likely to hear tidings of <i>him</i> through the Press; but
here Aurea was wrong. The unexpected—as is so
frequently the case—declared itself. One afternoon the
two ladies walked to a town at some distance, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
they waited for a well-deserved <i>café complét</i>, Mrs.
Ramsay idly glanced over an old and fly-blown copy of
the continental <i>Daily Mail</i>, and the following paragraph
caught her eye and seemed to stab her in the face:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The neighbourhood of Villo, near Turin, has been
shocked by a terrible accident, which took place yesterday.
Mr. H. Masham, the well-known racing motorist,
returning victorious from a competition, in order to avoid
a wagon, dashed into a hillside at full speed. The motor
turned over completely; he and the chauffeur were pinned
underneath. Mr. Masham was dead when extricated, and
there are no hopes of the recovery of his companion.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Ramsay made a desperate attempt to hide the
paper, but it was impossible to hide her own white face,
and Aurea insisted on reading the paragraph. When
she had grasped its contents, she turned to her friend
for a moment with great, agonised, unseeing eyes, and
for the first time in her life of twenty-one years Aurea
Morven fainted.</p>

<p>That same hour Mrs. Ramsay despatched a reply-paid
telegram to the Italian Hospital, asking for immediate
tidings of Mr. Owen, and the answer received was—</p>

<p>“Owen left yesterday—address unknown.”</p>

<p>Well, at any rate, he was still in the land of the living,
and from this important fact Miss Morven must extract
such comfort as she deserved.</p>

<p>The truth was, that the chauffeur’s injuries were not
so severe as had been supposed—a few cuts and bruises,
a slight concussion, and a broken collar-bone. His
fine constitution had speedily carried him out of the
doctor’s hands, and when Wynyard returned to London,
it was to find that his sister and her husband had
arrived as a part of the great tide that flows annually
from the West. Lady Kesters had heard of her brother’s
accident in New York, and spent a small fortune in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
cables, and now they met again, after a separation of
six months, with mutual satisfaction; but, in spite of her
insistence, Wynyard firmly resisted his sister’s invitation
to take up his quarters in Mount Street.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he answered, “that is not in the bond;
I’ll get through on my own. I’ve only four months to
work off. I can run in and out till I find another place.”</p>

<p>“What about money, my dear boy? Your stay in
that Italian hospital must have been expensive.”</p>

<p>“I was heavily insured against accidents; after my
first week with Masham—when I realised his style of
driving, I took out a policy for fifteen hundred pounds!”</p>

<p>“I wonder you dare get into a motor,” she said. “I
don’t see how you can possibly have any nerve left.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not such a wreck as all that; and, considering
everything, I got off uncommonly well. I’m sure poor
Masham was insane. He certainly looked it at times.
It’s my experience that there are quite a good-sized crowd
of lunatics about at large; I’ve knocked up against one
or two lately. Masham always prophesied he would be
killed in a motor accident—and seemed rather to glory
in the prospect.”</p>

<p>“You do tumble into the queerest situations—old
maids, dancers, madman! I must confess I cannot
understand why you remained with him, carrying your
life in your hands?”</p>

<p>“In Masham’s hands, you mean!” corrected her
brother; “he seldom allowed me to drive.”</p>

<p>“And if you had been killed, where, pray, did I come
in—or Aurea Morven?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Owen Wynyard’s next situation as chauffeur was
with a certain Mrs. Buckingham Brune, a wealthy
matron who had a fine place in the north of England.
Miss Weedon, her daughter by a first marriage, was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
notable heiress, and her mother was determined that
she should make an alliance befitting her great fortune
and fame. Her father, Sir Jacob Weedon, the son
of a peasant, had risen to wealth and honour solely
through his own active brain and dogged industry.
He had not the smallest desire to conceal his origin,
and often alluded to the days when he was “a poor,
half-fed body”; and his coal-pick actually hung as a
glorious trophy over the chimneypiece in his smoking-room.
But his wife was of a different type; she
smothered (when possible) his reminiscences, and desired,
since his death, to soar to other worlds—on the wings of
Ermentrude’s fortune; but Betsy Ermentrude, a simple
maiden in her prime, inherited her father’s character and
ideas, and had no craving for super-society or to wear
the coronet of a peeress. Her mother had married a
second time, a good-looking young man, many years her
junior; he was a lazy member of an impoverished
family, who had no objection to a luxurious home,
hunters, motors, pocket-money, and the best of shooting.
It was considered (among his intimates) that Toby Brune
had dropped into a “nice soft thing.” They were not,
however, thinking of Mrs. Brune, who was notoriously
as hard as nails, but of Toby’s enviable surroundings.</p>

<p>Miss Weedon made no rash assertions, never took
exception to her mother’s gay guests, but quietly made
up her mind that, as her parent had pleased herself, she
would do likewise, and shape her own life. Betsy was a
slight, sandy-haired girl with appealing blue eyes, a
determined mouth, and a radiant smile. Her figure was
willowy and graceful; in short, she was unnecessarily
pretty for an heiress.</p>

<p>This was the entourage in which the chauffeur now
found himself, his sole stipulation being to “live out.”
He had no desire to mix with the great staff of servants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
and found comfortable quarters at one of the gate
lodges. The family owned no less than three fine cars;
the one Wynyard drove was a Panhard—the exclusive
possession of Miss Weedon and her friends. Mrs. Brune
toured the country in a magnificent Mercédès. She was
a stout, black-haired lady, with a short neck and a full
meridian. To make her look young and slender was
the hopeless task of milliner and maid. Their employer
had, however, contrived to squeeze herself into the best
society, was a clever, pushing woman, who had early
acquired the art of “Who to know, and who not to
know.” Her cook was a notable French chef, and smart
guests, who stayed at the Court, invariably carried away
with them the happy tidings that “they had been done
remarkably well, and indirect everything was topping!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Buckingham Brune, for her husband’s benefit,
rented a fine moor in Scotland, and here the family
were luxuriously established for August and September.
Owen, by special permission, lived with one of the
keepers, and was chiefly employed to fetch guests to
and from the station, or to motor the ladies to the
neighbouring sights.</p>

<p>Occasionally Miss Weedon adventured forth alone,
and, at a discreet distance from the lodge, picked up a
certain young man—who, as it happened, was an
acquaintance of the chauffeur’s. Miss Weedon’s love-affairs
were not precisely his business, but they had his
sympathy and, if desired, his sanction. Supposing
Teddy Wantage were anxious to marry the heiress and
they liked one another, supposing he were man enough to
carry her off—who was to stand in their way? Not he!
He detested Mrs. Buckingham Brune, her preposterous
pretensions, and shameless tuft-hunting, and was fully
prepared to help old lame-dog Teddy over an awkward
matrimonial stile.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV<br>

<small>SIR RICHARD AS CHAPERON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Richard Wynyard</span> was passing through Edinburgh
on his way to London; he had been shooting up in
Perthshire, and found, as he drove up to Waverley Station,
that he had missed his train by two minutes—this,
and the fact that he felt some acute twinges of gout,
combined to make him a little short in his manner.
As he had an hour’s wait, he pushed up to the book-stall,
gruffly demanded an English paper, and tossed
a copper in payment. The copper missed its goal,
fell with a clang on the flags, and a young man, who was
also buying papers—a chauffeur chap,—turned about,
and Sir Richard found that he was face to face with
his nephew—also that he was extremely glad of the
meeting. The baronet was beginning to feel a bit
lonely in life; now that old age was reaching for him,
he experienced the lack of some personal belongings,
of comfort and hope in the future, and a sense of exclusion
and loneliness invaded him, especially in those
hours when he lay awake ’twixt dark and dawn. His
nearest of kin, Leila and Owen, had been out of touch
with him for many months—Leila away in the United
States, and Owen working his life or death sentence.</p>

<p>He had been terribly frightened at the time of Mr.
Masham’s accident, had sorely repented of his bargain
with his heir, and repeatedly said to himself, “There was
no doubt that motoring was an infernally risky business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Hullo, Owen!” he exclaimed, “what are you
doing here?”</p>

<p>“I’m driving a car. My people have just gone off
by the express.”</p>

<p>“Um—quite fit now?” looking him over from
head to foot.</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks; I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“And what’s your job?”</p>

<p>“I’m chauffeur to Mrs. Buckingham Brune, of Ashbourne
Court. She’s up here on a moor just now.”</p>

<p>“Buckingham Brune—yes—yes—I know—enormously
rich; daughter, a great heiress—let’s see—a
quarter of a million—Miss Weedon?”</p>

<p>“She was Miss Weedon till an hour ago; now she’s
Mrs. Wantage! I brought her in from the lodge this
morning, attended the wedding, and saw the runaway
couple off ten minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” Sir Richard gave a little stagger.
“What! eh? You don’t mean it! I say, what a fellow
you are for being in the thick of rows and bothers!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no bother to <i>me</i>,” replied his nephew carelessly;
“I’m only a chauffeur, not a chaperon; but I
must say I’m awfully glad Wantage brought it off!”</p>

<p>“And what a haul—half a million!”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, upon my honour, I don’t believe he was
thinking of the money. She’s an uncommonly nice
girl.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard’s face expressed scornful incredulity.</p>

<p>“Pity you didn’t go in for her yourself, eh!” Then,
after a meditative pause, “I expect there will be a
holy row! What will her mother say?”</p>

<p>“That remains to be heard! She wanted her
daughter to marry that drunken little sweep, Vippen—he’s
staying there now.”</p>

<p>“Lord Vippen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>He nodded.</p>

<p>“And it’s my painful duty to face the music, and
deliver the fatal letter.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard gave a long whistle.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s a job I don’t half fancy. Well, I must
be getting a move on—the car is just outside.” Then,
holding out his hand, “I’m awfully glad to have seen
you, Uncle Dick, and looking so fit.”</p>

<p>“I say, Owen,” suddenly taking him by the arm and
leading him aside, “<i>I’ve</i> had enough of this.”</p>

<p>His nephew stared at him interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Let’s cry quits—time’s up—all but a few weeks!
You have done uncommonly well, and I was an old
idiot.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so, sir. I believe it was quite
a sound idea; but, since you’ve given me the word,
I must confess I’m not sorry it’s finished.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you what, my boy—you gave me a
jolly good fright the time Masham was killed.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to my own fright when the car turned
over; but, I say, I must be off to Hillstan—it’s thirty
miles away—and do my errand. Where shall I find
you when I come back? I’m fairly safe to get the
kick out, and I expect I’ll have to walk to our nearest
drivelling little station.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Owen, I’ll hire a car. I’ll telephone
now, and go with you, and this other can fetch us back—we’ll
have a good talk.”</p>

<p>Owen was secretly amused, though his face was
impassive. Here was Uncle Dick, extraordinarily eager
for his company, actually chartering a motor, and
grudging him out of his sight for a couple of hours!
He never dreamt of the old man’s hungry heart—how,
at times, life seemed empty and hopeless—and he had
nothing to look forward to but the grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>The narrow escape of his nephew had brought home
to him that he was really fond of the scapegrace now
confronting him; even in a holland coat and chauffeur’s
cap, what a handsome, well-set-up young fellow! And
there was something different in this Owen: a look
of decision, manliness, and independence in his face;
a strain of confidence in his speech; even if he were
not the future Sir Owen Wynyard, this individual was
undeniably capable of “hoeing his own row.”</p>

<p>He felt proud of this nephew, who seemed to be
years older than the Owen of the Red Hussars or Owen
of the ranch—here was a full-grown man! As a
boy, Owen had never been afraid to look him squarely
in the face, but now his nephew’s eyes seemed to dominate
him altogether. Was it the younger generation knocking
at the door?</p>

<p>“Mind you, if we meet Mrs. Brune, and you are in her
car, she will run you in for a Joy rider!” said his nephew,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’d better go alone. I was only
thinking of backing you up when she tackles you.”</p>

<p>“Awfully good of you. I’ll get you to back me up
in earnest in another direction.”</p>

<p>“As long as it’s not a bill!” and Sir Richard actually
laughed.</p>

<p>“No, no; I’ve lots of money for a chauffeur—here’s
the car, a 45 h.p. Panhard—isn’t she a beauty?” he said,
as they arrived at the station entrance. “I’ll get it over
as soon as I can, and bring my traps to the Station Hotel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I dine at eight sharp—good luck to you!” and
he waved his hand to his nephew, and then stood watching
him as he steered through the traffic with admirable
judgment, and presently sped out of sight.</p>

<p>Then Sir Richard collected his luggage, engaged
rooms at the hotel, ordered a special reconciliation dinner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
and wired to Lady Kesters, “Have seen Owen—all is
square. Expect us to-morrow.”</p>

<p>At eight o’clock uncle and nephew, in glossy shirts and
evening-dress, sat down <i>tête-à-tête</i>, to enjoy their oysters.</p>

<p>“And what about Mrs. Buckingham Brune?”
inquired Sir Richard.</p>

<p>“She took it better than I expected. At first I
thought she was going to strike me, and I was in for
a bad time; but when she heard that Wantage was no
pauper, and that his maternal uncle was a duke, she
calmed down, and I expect after a little time they will
be all right. She actually got the <i>Peerage</i> and looked
him up on the spot—my word did not count! However,
we parted friends; and she sent me over in the car and
offered me a splendid reference.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you got round her! And what are your own
plans, my boy?”</p>

<p>“The agency—and Wynyard—and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s of course,” he interrupted; “but I mean
now—to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow I’d like to run up to Lossiemouth.”</p>

<p>“For golf—yes; but why not Berwick? It’s much
handier!”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Uncle Dick, I’m not specially interested
in any one in Berwick; but there’s a girl up north
that interests me more than any one in the world.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ah!</i>” hastily emptying his champagne glass, and
putting it down with a jerk.</p>

<p>“Now I’m no longer in service, and have some
prospects, I want to find out if she will marry me!”</p>

<p>“So it’s got as far as that, has it?”</p>

<p>“No, it has not even started. Last time we met, she
would not speak to me.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going on, then?”</p>

<p>“A mere chance. I believe there was a—a—misunderstanding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
so a friend told me; anyway, she’s the
only girl I could ever care for.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard became more and more interested.
Could it be possible that Owen had inherited such loyal
devotion from himself?</p>

<p>“Who is she?” he asked.</p>

<p>“She is Miss Morven, daughter of the Rector at
Ottinge and the Parretts’ niece. She sometimes came
out in the motor, and I used to see her in the garden.”</p>

<p>“And how did you make love to her—language of
flowers, hey?”</p>

<p>“No; I never was anything but the chauffeur. I see
by the <i>Scotsman</i> she is up at Lossiemouth with her uncle,
General Morven.”</p>

<p>“What—old Charlie Morven! Why, I know him.
I’ll go up there with you and see you through—and take
him out of your way.”</p>

<p>“Do—it will be awfully decent of you; but Miss
Morven may not have anything to do with <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“What! not marry my nephew with Wynyard at his
back and a fine fat fortune! Nonsense, nonsense!
Here, waiter, just fetch me a <i>Bradshaw</i>.” Then to his
companion, “I’ll wire for rooms to-night, and we will
make a start for Lossiemouth first thing to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV<br>

<small>REINSTATED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was dinner time in one of the larger hotels at Lossiemouth—a
soft September evening, the windows stood
wide, admitting the warm salt air, and above the clattering
of plates and voices, one occasionally caught the murmuring
of the North Atlantic, the creak of an oar, or the
scream of a seagull. At a table in one corner a party of
three were seated—a party that were, as a rule, accorded
an unusual and flattering amount of attention—a white-moustached
soldier, a dignified, elderly lady (whose grey
hair was undoubtedly dressed by a maid), and a remarkably
pretty, dark-eyed girl. They were in mourning, but
nothing so deep as to suggest an overwhelming calamity;
the young lady wore white, the elder black crêpe-de-chine,
the man black studs and a black tie, and their names in
the hotel register were “Major-General, Mrs., and Miss
Morven, London.”</p>

<p>Miss Parrett was no more; a sudden attack of “her
bronchitis”—she always spoke as if it were an exclusive
possession—had hurried her out of existence. She had,
however, executed her will, and after elaborate directions
respecting her funeral, her monument, and her hatchment,
it was found that she had bequeathed all she
possessed to her sister Susan, with the exception of her
automobile, which was left to her dear friend, Mrs.
Maria Wiggens; and whether this memento was instigated
by generosity or malice, is a debated question until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
present hour. There were no legacies to charities, or
even the smallest souvenir for her special little clique.
The contents of the testament were a sore disappointment
to some, but few grudged Miss Susan independence and
fortune, for she knew how to make excellent use of both.
Isabella Parrett was no more, and Susan, her sister,
reigned in her stead.</p>

<p>The Morven family, who were not real heart-and-soul
golfers, were beginning to weary of the one perpetual
subject that surrounded them from morning till night.
The difficulties of the fifth tee, vivid descriptions of the
various approaches, bunkers, and greens, had palled
somewhat—even on the General. He secretly languished
for the society of some one who had been in the Service,
and a chance of discussing the late manœuvres as
described in the daily Press. New arrivals were always
a matter of interest, and here came two—ushered by
the head waiter. There was a certain stir and a good
deal of staring as a little elderly gentleman, with very
square shoulders, and a young man—possibly his son—approached.</p>

<p>“I say!” ejaculated General Morven, laying down
his spoon, “if here isn’t old Dicky Wynyard!” and
he rose from his seat and made signals. “Yes—and his
nephew.”</p>

<p>Aurea looked up with startled eyes, and became
suddenly white. There was Owen approaching in the
wake of his uncle; he wore an air of complete self-possession,
the usual dinner-coat, and had undoubtedly
cast off the rôle of chauffeur.</p>

<p>“I say, this <i>is</i> good luck!” exclaimed the General,
extending a genial hand. “Fancy meeting you up here,
Sir Richard! I did not know you ever came North!
Hullo, Wynyard, glad to see you. I’ve not come across
you in the club for ages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“Yes; I’ve been recommended to Lossiemouth to
get the real, unadulterated air straight from the North
Pole and to have a little golf, and I’ve brought this
young fellow along with me,” Sir Richard answered,
lying boldly and with ease; his nephew was positively
staggered by such fluent proficiency.</p>

<p>“I think you know my wife,” said the General.
“Yes; let me introduce you to my niece, Miss Morven.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard bowed, and said—</p>

<p>“And allow me to present my nephew, Mr. Wynyard—Mrs.
Morven,” and, accompanying his introduction
with a sharp glance, “Miss Morven.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wynyard and I have already met,” she
announced, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then,” said her uncle heartily.
“Now we all know one another,” and he rubbed his
hands. “Sir Richard, will you sit at our table? There
is lots of room for five.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, we shall be delighted.”</p>

<p>“How did you discover Lossiemouth?” inquired
Mrs. Morven when the newcomers were seated.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is, I never heard of it till lately, and
then a friend strongly advised me to try it—he said
it was just the place to suit me.” He glanced complacently
at his nephew, as much as to claim approval.
“I’m uncommonly glad to meet you, General; we
can have some rounds together. What’s your handicap?”</p>

<p>As the two older men talked, Mrs. Morven proceeded
to cultivate the younger, and Aurea for once felt herself
out in the cold and—what was more serious—indescribably
ill at ease. She dropped her fork, helped herself
twice to salt, and crumbled her uncle’s bread.</p>

<p>It was evident that Owen, or, rather, Mr. Wynyard,
had made his peace and was reinstated in his proper
niche in society. Why had he come to Lossiemouth?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
Why was Sir Richard looking at her so keenly with his
little searching eyes? Why was Owen making himself
so extremely agreeable to her aunt?—listening, with
reverent sympathy, to a harrowing description of her
neuralgia, and a still more harrowing account of the
death of her beautiful prize blue Persian—run over by
a motor in Eaton Place.</p>

<p>“Think of it! A motor—a motor going over a cat!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid motors are no respecter of persons or
cats. As to dogs, they are killed by the dozen.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morven shuddered, sipped her claret, and
turned the subject to books and fiction.</p>

<p>“I hope you have brought something fresh? Our
stock is nearly exhausted.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, only a couple of magazines; I was
reading a thriller in the train. The worst of it is, that
just as you become passionately interested and something
tremendous is going to happen, you are choked
off by a full-page advertisement of pills or boot polish.
I like my fiction undiluted; don’t you?”</p>

<p>Aurea was amazed at this flow of conversation from
the monosyllabic Owen. Evidently Owen was one
individual, and Mr. Wynyard another. She was even
more impressed by the quiet confidence of his manner.
Had he noted her embarrassment and nervousness?
Suddenly he turned to her, and said—</p>

<p>“And how is Ottinge, Miss Morven?”</p>

<p>The question was so unexpected that for an instant
she could not find her voice; there seemed to be an
obstruction in her throat, but she managed to reply—</p>

<p>“It is much as usual.”</p>

<p>“What! no change in twelve months!” he exclaimed,
in a key of surprise. “Oh, but, of course, the
world flows very deliberately in that sleepy old village.
And how is Mrs. Ramsay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“Very well; she generally has a houseful of nephews
and nieces, very Irish and lively.”</p>

<p>“And the Hogbens—are they flourishing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, old Mrs. Topham is dead; she left a great deal
of money in unexpected places. Tom and Dilly are comparatively
rich, and have moved into Claringsbold.”</p>

<p>“So Miss Susan will have to look out for another
gardener?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but she keeps three and a boy. She has a
beautiful Panhard landaulet.”</p>

<p>“I say—you don’t mean it!”</p>

<p>“And she is talking of putting up a conservatory, and
has begun to build a cottage hospital.”</p>

<p>“I won’t recognise the place. Is the Drum still
standing? Have you a rink and a theatre?”</p>

<p>Aurea smiled.</p>

<p>“And how is my dear old pal, Joss?”</p>

<p>“Getting a little stout for want of exercise.”</p>

<p>“I’d no idea you knew Ottinge so well,” put in Mrs.
Morven. “What a memory you have!”</p>

<p>“For some things, my memory is like a rat-trap, and
for others my mind is a blank.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you stayed at Westmere for the shooting?”
broke in the General.</p>

<p>“No; but”—and he glanced at Aurea—“I’ve often
been there. What has become of Bertie Woolcock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, by Jove! didn’t you hear? He went off to
India to shoot big game, and got caught himself! A
very pretty, smart American girl he met on board ship—no
money—so on this occasion Uncle Sam has scored as
regards the dollars.”</p>

<p>By this time dinner had been brought to a close with
large cups of milky coffee, and the Morven party rose and
drifted into the hall. It was Aurea’s custom to sit out
on the verandah with her uncle as he smoked; her aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
betook herself and her neuralgia into the drawing-room
and there sat knitting amidst an agreeable circle of
matrons—chiefly Scotch. To-night, she half expected
Aurea to accompany her, and the young lady herself
was undecided. The two elder men were lingering in
the hall, lighting up, and had already commenced an
animated discussion.—Owen had not yet produced his
cigar case.—She was on the point of following her
chaperon, much as she disliked sitting indoors this
exquisite September night, when he said—</p>

<p>“Will you come for a stroll with me?”</p>

<p>She nodded assent, and turned to reach for her wrap
with a fast beating heart. The door had already closed
on Mrs. Morven’s stately form, and the young couple
walked out through the porch, with a matter of course
air, and crossed the road towards the golf links and the
beach. Sir Richard followed them with his keen little
eyes, but General Morven was far too much engrossed in
a Service grievance to see beyond his nose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI<br>

<small>BY MOONLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it was a lovely evening, many other couples were on
the links or the shore, lured abroad by the beauty of the
scene, the clear radiance of the northern sky, and the
brilliance of a harvest moon. A soft, almost languorous
little breeze, stirred the long coarse grass among the dunes—perhaps
it had stolen across the bay from those dark
mountains of Rossshire, carrying tender messages from
the purple heather? To-night, the great burners in the
lighthouse had a sinecure, for it was as bright as day.
From a villa overlooking the sea, a violin and piano
flooded the air with sounds that seemed to evoke the
very spirit of romance—a passionate triumph of the
greatest gift in life.</p>

<p>As Aurea and her companion descended to the shore,
they had scarcely exchanged a word beyond Wynyard’s
“Mind that stone,” and “Let us get away from the
crowd, right down to the sea.”</p>

<p>Aurea felt inwardly agitated, but determined to do
her utmost to exercise self-control. She knew instinctively
that the most critical hour in her life was about to
strike. In a somewhat unsteady voice she broke the
silence—a woman sometimes does speak first.</p>

<p>“You are the very last person in the world I expected
to see.”</p>

<p>He turned and faced her.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“For several reasons.”</p>

<p>“Can you guess the reason why I came up to Lossiemouth,
and why I have asked you to come out with me?
I am a free man since yesterday; the yoke is off, the gag
is out of my mouth, and I want to repeat what I told
you on Yampton Hill—that I love you.”</p>

<p>There was a long pause, broken by the soft whispering
of the ebbing waves.</p>

<p>“I wonder you do!” said the girl at last; her voice
broke as she added, “after Monte Carlo.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; I admit that that was pretty bad, and
quite bowled me over; but Mrs. Ramsay explained—she
has been a good friend to me.”</p>

<p>“I did not know you had a sister,” continued Aurea,
with a sort of sob.</p>

<p>“You knew nothing about me, and now you shall
hear everything;” and in a few hurried sentences he told
her of India, Canterbury, and the bill, his debts, of the
City office, and the ranch.</p>

<p>“You see, Uncle Dick’s patience was fairly worn
out, and, honestly, I don’t wonder. I was always coming
back on his hands; so he gave me the two years’ sentence
to earn my own bread, and be independent. I’m an
awful duffer in many ways, and I talked it over with
Leila—my sister, you know. I had to make a start at
once, for one thing, and I’d no chance of any good billet—everything
now is examinations, or capital. I suggested
enlisting or breaking horses, but she put forward the
chauffeur scheme; it was rather a crazy idea, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You were a capital driver—even
Bertie Woolcock allowed that!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, Leila foisted me on your aunts—it
was pretty cool, I’ll admit—and just at first—I—well—I
felt I couldn’t stand it. I’d had a fairly rough time
in the Argentine—it wasn’t that—but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“I know,” she broke in, “it was Aunt Bella.”</p>

<p>“I was not used to old ladies, and she was so—er—peculiar;
I believe, to the last, she thought I sold or drank
the petrol. Well, I’d made up my mind to clear out,
and then—I saw you, and I decided to hold on—yes,
like grim death. It was a lucky day for me when you
came to the Manor—otherwise, I’d have gone away, and
no doubt drifted about, and become a regular slacker;
but you held me fast. I settled down, I made the best
of the job, and took everything as it came in the day’s
work—for your sake.”</p>

<p>Aurea nodded.</p>

<p>“I got to like the Ottinge folk, and to know them
and their rustic ways, and, living as a working man,
it was a splendid chance for me to learn many things
I was as ignorant of, as that stone. I used to sit in the
tap and listen to the talk, and got to see things from a
different perspective. And I’d some good times, too,
at choir practice, and penny readings, and the night
of the servants’ ball at Westmere, when I had one
delicious waltz with you—do you remember?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed, and how Bertie Woolcock snatched
me away, and said ladies should never dance with men-servants,
and I replied, that his mother had opened the
ball with the butler!”</p>

<p>“You had him there; and then came my London
situation, and the time with Masham, and now it’s all
over. I met Uncle Dick yesterday by chance, and he
has been a brick. We had a rare good old talk last
night, and I told him the history of the last eighteen
months. I’m to manage the property, go into the
Yeomanry, live at Wynyard—it’s a big rambling old
house—and he thinks I ought to marry; what do <i>you</i>
say?”</p>

<p>Aurea was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“My sister declares that in all her life she never
heard of anything so outrageously audacious and impertinent,
as my imploring you to accept me blindfold;
and, as it is—you know so little of me. Why, we never
sat at table together till to-night. I’ve always been
below the salt!”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking and awaited her reply, Aurea
plucked up her courage and said: “But I do know
you—I know you are kind and patient, and good-tempered,
and to be trusted.”</p>

<p>“And you do care for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I—always did—though I fought against it;
and most of the time I knew your name was Wynyard,
and that you’d been in the Service.”</p>

<p>“But how on earth did you find it out?”</p>

<p>“By chance, from a Hussar in Brodfield; as he passed
I heard him say to his companion, ‘That’s Lieutenant
Wynyard,’ but I kept the information to myself.”</p>

<p>“And now there are no longer any secrets between
us—you and I belong to one another, don’t we?”</p>

<p>As Aurea, with a slight but significant gesture, assented,
he drew her close to him, she yielded, and he stooped and
kissed her.</p>

<p>Someone in the villa above was playing Tschaikowsky’s
“Chant sans paroles,” and its tender and exquisite
harmonies seemed an appropriate accompaniment to the
scene upon the shore.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock, and Mrs. Morven, who was knitting
and counting, frowning and thinking, suddenly overheard
a long-legged lassie, with a tawny mane, say to
her mother, in a tone of repressed excitement—</p>

<p>“Mother—only think! You know the pretty girl—the
one we all admire—I saw her on the beach just now,
a good bit away, and she was crying I’m sure—and the
young gentleman who came at dinner time <i>kissed her</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Morven rolled up her stocking, arose with
deliberate dignity, and sailed forth into the hall, where
she found her husband and Sir Richard talking to one
another, with great animation, on the subject of rubber
shares.</p>

<p>“Where,” she inquired, with a dramatic gesture,
“is Aurea? and,” casting a keen glance at Sir Richard,
“where is Mr. Wynyard?”</p>

<p>The General could put two and two together as well
as most men. Yes, it would do—nice young fellow—old
family—baronetcy—and lots of money; and, nodding
at his companion with undisguised significance,
he said, as he rose—</p>

<p>“I say, Sir Richard, I suppose you and I will have
to make a search-party and bring our young people
home!” (Our young people!)</p>

<p>Perhaps it is unnecessary to add that the same young
people were by no means grateful for their disinterested
exertions. That night, at a very late hour, Aurea confided
to her aunt that she was engaged to Owen Wynyard.
Mrs. Morven, who had accompanied her niece to her
bedroom, stood by the table, knitting in hand—an
embodiment of the judicial British matron.</p>

<p>“Engaged! What nonsense, my dear girl! Why,
you don’t know him! Where have you met him?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I do; I knew him at Ottinge. He was
Aunt Bella’s chauffeur for six months.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morven took two hurried steps to a chair, sat
down upon it, and gasped.</p>

<p>“Your aunts’ chauffeur!” she exclaimed at last.
New and bright ideas suddenly dawned upon her mental
horizon. She never remembered to have heard her
niece mention the chauffeur—though more than once
she had spoken disparagingly of the green car. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
silence, she now realised, had held a most deadly significance.
Yes, she saw it all—the good-looking chauffeur
had been at the bottom of <i>everything</i>: of Aurea’s indifference
to young men, her indifference to amusement—was
he the reason that last winter her niece’s brilliant
young beauty had become tarnished? She looked up
at her to-night; Aurea was supremely lovely.</p>

<p>“I see I have stunned you, Aunt Maggie.”</p>

<p>“And he was at Monte Carlo. Yes; I now remember
him perfectly. I thought the face was familiar; but
why a chauffeur?”</p>

<p>“For the reason I refer you to his humpy little old
uncle; but it’s all right now.”</p>

<p>“Of course he is Leila Hesters’ brother, and Sir
Richard’s heir—Wynyard of Wynyard. Yes; I remember
hearing that the young man was very wild
and extravagant, raced and gambled. However, he is
remarkably good-looking, and has charming manners;
no doubt he has sown his wild oats—I don’t envy him
being in your Aunt Parrett’s service for six months!”
(These ladies had detested one another.) “<i>That</i> was
enough punishment for anything! I suppose he really
was employed—not make-believe?”</p>

<p>“Make-believe! Employed! I should just think
so—washing the car, gardening, clipping hedges, cleaning
windows——”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” throwing up her delicate hands;
“what possessed him to stay?”</p>

<p>Aurea laughed and coloured, and then said—</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Maggie—I—I suppose <i>I</i> had something
to say to it.”</p>

<p>“He must be extraordinarily devoted! Why, he
must adore you, my dear! I’m sure your uncle would
never have cleaned windows and washed cars for <i>me</i>! Ha!
ha! well, Aurea, I confess I like your—er—chauffeur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“But he’s not a chauffeur now, and will soon have
a motor of his own. He is his uncle’s agent; we are
to live at Wynyard, and have a splendid allowance.
Owen means to do a lot for the tenants, and I’m to take
over the village girls—oh, we have had such a talk!”</p>

<p>“A talk! Yes, no doubt. What will your father
and Susan say?”</p>

<p>“They will be enchanted; they are both fond of
Owen; indeed, for one whole day, the village was thrilled
with the idea that Susan and Owen had <i>eloped</i>!” and
she related the story with so much of her old spirit, that
her aunt lay back in her chair and laughed till she wept.</p>

<p>“I believe I shall like young Wynyard,” she repeated,
as she dried her eyes, “and you know your uncle and I
look on you, Aurea, as our own child, so the General
will have a word in the settlements; and when you
marry, you shall have my emerald necklace. Good-night,
dearest. I must go off and talk this over with
my old man. I declare I feel so excited, that I’m sure
I shall not sleep a wink.”</p>

<p>And what of Aurea, to whom Destiny had brought
a rapturous fate within the last two hours? She pulled
up the blind, opened wide the window, and, leaning her
arms on the sill, gazed upon the scene—the gently
heaving ocean, the vast, limitless firmament, the silver
moonlight—and wondered, was any girl in all the wide
world as happy as herself?</p>
